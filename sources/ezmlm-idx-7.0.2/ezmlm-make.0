DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up a new mailing list, _l_o_c_a_l@@_h_o_s_t, along  with  several
       extra addresses to handle administrative requests.

       All  mailing  list  information is stored in a new directory, _d_i_r.  _d_i_r
       must be an absolute pathname, starting with a slash.  _d_o_t  must  be  an
       absolute  file name starting with a slash. Arguments other than _d_i_r may
       be omitted when editing an existing list, using the --ee  or  --++  options
       (see below).

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  is  controlled  by a template, ..eezzmmllmmrrcc.  Described here is
       the behavior with the default template file.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will  print  a
       warning  message  before  continuing,  if  the ezmlmrc version does not
       match the eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee version.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee aallssoo ccrreeaatteess _d_i_r//ccoonnffiigg, where it stores  all  configuration
       information.  By  reading  this  file,  you can rapidly get information
       about how the list is set up.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee when used with the --ee  switch
       will  read  information from this file. Thus, when using eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee --ee,
       you only need to specify the desired switches and switch arguments  and
       _d_i_r.   With  the --++ switch all switches become sticky, i.e. the default
       for all switches (and command line arguments) becomes the switches  and
       arguments  active  for  the  list to be edited. Note that the choice of
       config file also is sticky, except when running eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee as root.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up  four  ..qqmmaaiill  files:  _d_o_t,  _d_o_t--oowwnneerr,  _d_o_t--rreettuurrnn--
       ddeeffaauulltt,  and  _d_o_t--ddeeffaauulltt.   You  should  make  sure  that messages to
       _l_o_c_a_l@@_h_o_s_t, _l_o_c_a_l--oowwnneerr@@_h_o_s_t,  etc.  are  controlled  by  these  ..qqmmaaiill
       files.

       For  message  moderated lists, eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up two additional ..qqmmaaiill
       files: _d_o_t--aacccceepptt--ddeeffaauulltt and _d_o_t--rreejjeecctt--ddeeffaauulltt.

       For digested lists, eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up another two  ..qqmmaaiill  file:  _d_o_t--
       ddiiggeesstt--rreettuurrnn--ddeeffaauulltt and _d_o_t--ddiiggeesstt--oowwnneerr.

       If _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e is specified, digest creation by eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) via trigger
       messages to the _l_o_c_a_l//@@_h_o_s_t--ddiigg.._d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e address is enabled.

       By default, eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up lists to  add  a  ‘‘X-No-Archive:  yes’’
       header  to  outgoing messages.  Public archiving servers will interpret
       this header as a request not to archive messages from the list. It this
       in  not  what  you  desire,  remove this header from eezzmmllmmrrcc for global
       effects, or from _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerraadddd for the specific list.

       Typical use of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee by a normal user:

          ezmlm-make ~joe/SOS ~joe/.qmail-sos joe-sos isp.net

       Typical use of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee by aalliiaass:

          ezmlm-make ~alias/SOS ~alias/.qmail-sos sos isp.net
          chown -R alias ~alias/SOS

       Typical use of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee by a normal user enabling automatic digests:

          ezmlm-make -d ~joe/SOS ~joe/.qmail-sos joe-sos isp.net

       Typical use of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee to change an existing list in ~joe/SOS  to  a
       message  moderated  list  with  remote administration, and enabling the
       remote administrator(s) to retrieve  a  subscriber  list  and  to  edit
       _d_i_r//tteexxtt files (digest are still enabled):

          ezmlm-make -emrldn ~joe/SOS

       Mail  can arrive at any time!  For safe editing, turn on the sticky bit
       of the home directory before editing the list setup, then turn  it  off
       again (see ddoott--qqmmaaiill((55))).

       Moderator addresses are added with

         ezmlm-sub ~joe/SOS mod mod1@host1 mod2@host2 ...

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee also creates the necessary text files in _d_i_r//tteexxtt//.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  has  a  large  number of switches to control all aspects of
       list generation.  Only defaults or a small subset of switches are  nec‐
       essary  for  most  list  setups. Other options are present primarily to
       allow a external CGI script or other graphical user  interface  to  use
       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee to manipulate ezmlm list setups.

VVIIRRTTUUAALL DDOOMMAAIINNSS
       To  create  the  list  ‘‘tl@virtual.dom’’ where ‘‘virtual.dom’’ is con‐
       trolled by ‘‘vu’’ (virtual.dom:vu), change identity to ‘‘vu’’ or  chown
       files to that user after:

            ezmlm-make ~vu/dir ~vu/.qmail-tl tl virtual.dom

       Thus, create the list exactly as for a list under ‘‘alias’’.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  letter  switches  except  --vv  and --VV are available for
       interpretation via _e_z_m_l_m_r_c.  Switches --ee, --EE, --cc, and --CC  have  special
       meaning  within  the program.  _e_z_m_l_m_r_c customization should respect the
       function of the switches described here.

       --++   Switches currently active for the list will be used,  as  modified
            by  the current command line.  Thus, --++ makes switches ‘‘sticky’’.
            By default, only switches specified on the  current  command  line
            will  be used.  This switch implies --ee as it is meaningless except
            in edit mode. Note that the config file choice (see --cc and --CC)  is
            also  sticky.   eezzmmllmmrrcc((55))  is set up so that most text files (and
            _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerraadddd, _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerrkkeeeepp, and _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee) are not over‐
            written  if they already exist so as to preserve manual customiza‐
            tions. If _l_o_c_a_l is specified eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  overrides  this  behavior
            and  all  files  are  rewritten.  You can also force eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee to
            rewrite all files by using --++++.

       --aa   (Default.) Archived and configured with eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11))  for  archive
            access.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  touch  _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivveedd and _d_i_r//iinnddeexxeedd so
            that eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) will archive new messages.

       --AA   Not archived.

       --bb   Block archive. Only moderators are allowed to access the  archive.

       --BB   (Default.)   Archive access is open to anyone or subscribers only,
            depending on the --gg switch.

       --cc   Config.  Use _._e_z_m_l_m_r_c (see CONFIGURATION) from the directory where
            _d_o_t  resides.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  otherwise uses the system wide ezmlmrc
            file (normally _/_e_t_c_/_e_z_m_l_m_/_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_/_e_z_m_l_m_r_c).   The  --cc  switch  may
            cause you to execute eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee based on a configuration file con‐
            trolled by another user.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee does not allow periods in any
            tag  to  restrict all actions to within _d_i_r.  Be careful with this
            option setting up lists for other users, especially  when  running
            eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee as root.

       --CC _a_r_g
            Like --cc, but use file _a_r_g as the ezmlmrc file.  Use --CC _’_’ to over‐
            ride a default when using --++ or --ee.  If the given path is a direc‐
            tory  instead  of  a  file,  the  actual  ezmlmrc file is taken as
            _a_r_g_/_e_z_m_l_m_r_c, and the other ezmlm-idx programs will use the  direc‐
            tory to look up files (such as text files) that are not present in
            the list directory.

       --dd   Digest.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will set up the _l_o_c_a_l--ddiiggeesstt@@hhoosstt digest  list
            to  disseminate  digest  of the list messages. By default, this is
            done when 30 messages, 48 hours, or 64 kbytes of message body text
            have  accumulated  since  the  last digest. Edit the _d_i_r//ddiiggccoouunntt,
            _d_i_r//ddiiggssiizzee, or _d_i_r//ddiiggttiimmee files to override these defaults.  See
            eezzmmllmm--ttssttddiigg((11)) and eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) for more info.

       --DD   (Default.)  No digest.  Do not set up the digest list.

       --ee   Edit.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  remove  links  before  creating them and
            accept if directories to be created  are  already  present.   will
            also  (via  entries  in _e_z_m_l_m_r_c) remove flags that are present but
            not desired for the current list.  Thus, this option can  be  used
            to reconfigure existing lists without affecting moderator and sub‐
            scriber lists or message archive. All desired eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  switches
            need to be specified. To make all switches sticky, i.e. only spec‐
            ify the ones changed from the previous  setup,  use  --++.   Command
            line  arguments  other  than  _d_i_r can be omitted.  In the unlikely
            case where _d_o_t is changed, you must manually remove the old links.
            Mail can arrive at any time!  For safe editing, turn on the sticky
            bit of the home directory before using  the  edit  function,  then
            turn  it  off  again  (see ddoott--qqmmaaiill((55))).  eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)) is set up so
            that most  text  files  (and  _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerraadddd,  _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerrkkeeeepp,  and
            _D_I_R//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee)  are not overwritten if they already exist so as
            to preserve manual customizations. If _l_o_c_a_l  is  specified  eezzmmllmm--
            mmaakkee  overrides this behavior and all files are rewritten. You can
            also force eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee to rewrite all files by using --eeee.

       --EE   (Default.)  No edit.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  abort  if  directories  or
            links to be created already exist. This prevents accidental recon‐
            figuration of a pre-existing list, since the first  action  is  to
            create the list directory.

       --ff   Prefix.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will set up the list so that the outgoing sub‐
            ject will be prefixed with the list name.

       --FF   (Default.)  No prefix.

       --gg   Guard archive.  Archive access requests from unrecognized  SENDERs
            will  be  rejected.   This  restriction is safe, since replies are
            sent to the SENDER address.

       --GG   (Default.)  Do not guard archive.  Archive access request from any
            SENDER will be serviced.

       --hh   Help  subscription.  Subscriptions  do  not  require confirmation.
            Strongly recommended  against,  since  anyone  can  subscribe  any
            address,  but may be useful for some subscription moderated lists.

       --HH   (Default.)  Subscription requires confirmation by reply to a  mes‐
            sage sent to the subscription address.

       --ii   Indexed  for  WWW archive access.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will create the list
            so that eezzmmllmm--aarrcchhiivvee((11)) is invoked to maintain an index  suitable
            for use by eezzmmllmm--ccggii((11)).

       --II   (Default.)  The list is created without eezzmmllmm--aarrcchhiivvee((11)).

       --jj   Jump off. Unsubscribe does not require confirmation. Strongly rec‐
            ommended against, since anyone can unsubscribe  any  address,  but
            may be useful in some situations.

       --JJ   (Default.)  Unsubscribe requires confirmation by a reply to a mes‐
            sage sent to the subscription address.

       --kk

       --KK   Ignored for backwards compatibility.   The  _d_i_r//ddeennyy//  subscribers
            directory  is  always  created  to  allow  denying  messages  from
            selected addresses.  This is useful in  combination  with  the  --uu
            switch  to  temporarily  restrain offenders, such as misconfigured
            auto-responders or automatic spammers.  It can  also  be  used  in
            combination with --mm to filter out SENDERs from whom the moderators
            do not want to see posts (again, bad re-mailers and spammers  come
            to mind).

            To add/remove blacklisted addresses:

       --ll   List  subscribers.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  sets  up  the list so that remote
            administrators can request a subscriber list, and search the  sub‐
            scriber log.

       --LL   (Default.)  The subscriber list cannot be obtained.

       --mm   Message  moderation.  (Please note that the --uu sswwiittcchh mmooddiiffiieess the
            action of this switch.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  touch  _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt  and
            create  _d_i_r//mmoodd//  and  _d_i_r//mmoodd//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//,  where  the moderator
            addresses are stored.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee also  creates  _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//,
            _d_i_r//mmoodd//aacccceepptteedd//,  and  _d_i_r//mmoodd//rreejjeecctteedd//.  These directories are
            used to queue messages awaiting moderation.   _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr  will  be
            set  up  to  run  eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11)) to store incoming messages in the
            moderation queue and send moderation requests to  the  moderators.
            _d_i_r//mmooddeerraattoorr will be set up to run eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee to process mod‐
            erator _a_c_c_e_p_t or _r_e_j_e_c_t requests.

       --MM   (Default.)  Message posting is not moderated.

       --nn   New text file.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up the list to allow remote admin‐
            istrators to edit files in _d_i_r//tteexxtt//.

       --NN   (Default.)  Not new text file.  Text file editing not allowed.

       --oo   Others  rejected.   Posts from addresses other than moderators are
            rejected. This is applicable to message moderated lists only  (see
            --mm).  The switch has no effect on other lists.

       --OO   (Default.)   Others  not rejected.  For moderated lists, all posts
            are forwarded to the moderators.  The switch has effects  only  on
            message moderated lists.

       --pp   (Default.)  Public.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  touch  _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc, so that
            eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11)) will respond to administrative requests and eezzmmllmm--
            ggeett will allow archive retrieval.

       --PP   Private.   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11)) and eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) will allow only digest
            creation, remote administration, and archive retrieval  by  remote
            administrators, (if the list is configured with these options).

       --qq

       --QQ   Ignored  for  backwards  compatibility.   The  request  address is
            always  serviced.   Commands  sent  in  the  subject   to   _l_o_c_a_l--
            rreeqquueesstt@@_h_o_s_t are processed by eezzmmllmm--rreeqquueesstt((11)).

       --rr   Remote  admin.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee enables remote administration by touch‐
            ing _d_i_r//rreemmoottee.  Moderator(s) can unsubscribe  and  subscribe  any
            address.   See the --mm option on how moderator addresses are stored
            and manipulated.

       --RR   (Default.) No remote administration.

       --ss   Subscription moderation.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee enables subscription  modera‐
            tion  by touching _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb.  This affects subscriptions for both
            the main list and the digest list.  See the --mm option on how  mod‐
            erator addresses are stored and manipulated.

       --SS   (Default.) Subscriptions are not moderated.

       --tt   Trailer.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  create _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ttrraaiilleerr to set up the
            list to add a trailer to outgoing messages.

       --TT   No trailer.  (Default.)

       --uu   User posts only.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up the list so  that  posts  and
            archive  access is restricted to subscribers.  These are addresses
            subscribed to the main list, the digest, or added manually to  the
            address  database  in _d_i_r//aallllooww// which accommodates addresses from
            e.g. subscribers working from an address  other  than  their  sub‐
            scriber address.

            Posts  from  unrecognized SENDER addresses will be rejected.  This
            is relatively easily defeated for posts.  More secure alternatives
            are  message  moderated  lists  configured  with the eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee --mm
            switch (without the --uu switch).

            There is no reason to combine of SENDER checks on posts with  mes‐
            sage  moderation. Therefore, the combination of the --uu switch with
            the --mm switch is used for a configuration with SENDER restrictions
            (like with --uu alone), with the difference that posts from non-sub‐
            scribers will be sent for moderation instead  of  being  rejected.
            This  allows  the list admin to let non-subscribers post occasion‐
            ally, as well as to catch subscribers posting from  non-subscriber
            addresses.

       --UU   (Default.)  Do not restrict posts based on SENDER address.

       --vv   Display eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee version information.

       --VV   Display eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee version information.

       --ww   Remove  the  eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn((11))  invocations from the list setup. It is
            assumed  that  eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn((11))  for  both  _l_o_c_a_l_@_h_o_s_t   and   _l_o_c_a_l--
            ddiiggeesstt@@_h_o_s_t  will  be  run  by other means, such as crond.  As the
            main list will have only sublists as subscribers, it is  desirable
            to  log  bounces  and  feedback  messages  rather than to remove a
            bouncing subscriber.

       --WW   (Default.)  No address restriction. Normal  use  of  eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn((11))
            and eezzmmllmm--rreettuurrnn((11)).

       --xx   eXtra.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  will  configure  the  list with a few extras:
            _d_i_r//mmiimmeerreemmoovvee will be configured to  strip  annoying  mime  parts
            such  as excel spreadsheets, rtf text, html text etc from the mes‐
            sages. Messages consisting solely of  this  Content-type  will  be
            rejected. See eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) and eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt((11)) for more info.

       --yy   sender  confirmation.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will configure the list so post‐
            ing requires sender confirmation.

       --YY   (Default.) No sender confirmation is required.



       --00 _m_a_i_n_l_i_s_t_@_h_o_s_t
            Make the list a sublist of list _m_a_i_n_l_i_s_t_@_h_o_s_t.

       --33 _f_r_o_m_a_r_g
            eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee sets up the list to replace the ‘‘From:’’ header
            of the message with ‘‘From: _f_r_o_m_a_r_g’’.

       --55 _o_w_n_e_r_@_h_o_s_t
            eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will configure the list to forward mail directed
            to the list owner to _o_w_n_e_r_@_h_o_s_t.

            Subscriber database info. Use  the  database  plugin  named
            _p_l_u_g_i_n  which connects to _h_o_s_t (default localhost), on port
            number _p_o_r_t (default port for  SQL  server)  as  _u_s_e_r  with
            _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d using database _d_a_t_a_b (default "ezmlm") and the ta‐

       --77 _/_m_s_g___m_o_d___p_a_t_h
            Make _/_p_a_t_h the path to the database for message moderators,
            if   the   list   is   set   up   for  message  moderation.
            _/_m_s_g___m_o_d___p_a_t_h must be an absolute pathname, starting with a

            tion moderators, if the list is  set  up  for  subscription

LLIISSTT EEDDIITTIINNGG
       When  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  is  used  with the --ee switch, and the list was
       previously created or edited with a new (ezmlm-idx >= 0.23) ver‐
       sion of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee, all arguments other than _d_i_r can be omitted.
       In this case, arguments  will  be  read  from  _d_i_r//ccoonnffiigg.   The
       appropriate  flags  must  always  be specified. To override _d_o_t,
       _l_o_c_a_l, _h_o_s_t, or _c_o_d_e, all arguments must be specified.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       This version of eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee is template driven. The template file
       consists  of  plain  text with four types of tags. Both start in
       the first position of the line.  No other text is allowed on the
       same line. For security reasons, no periods are allowed anywhere
       in a tag.  Any line with a ‘‘#’’ in position 1 is ignored, as is
       any text preceding the first tag.

       <<//ffiilleennaammee##aaII//>>
              The  following text will be copied to _d_i_r//ffiilleennaammee if the
              options specified after the ‘‘#’’  are  active,  in  this
              case  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d  and not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.  Any number of flags can
              be specified. This is used to adapt the  files  and  mes‐
              sages  to the type of list created. If no flags are used,
              the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted. If the file name is the same as
              the  previous  tag, or if it is omitted, the text will be
              added to the previous file.  When a new  file  is  opened
              the previous file is closed. Attempts to add more text to
              a already closed file overwrites its contents.

              An alternative to specify that a flag, e.g. ‘‘4’’  should
              not  be  active  is to prefix the switch with ‘‘^’’, e.g.
              use ‘‘^4’’.  The ‘‘E’’ flag is treated in a special  man‐
              ner. When the list is being edited, it evaluates to false
              if the file already exists, true if it  does  not.  Thus,
              files using this condition are not overwritten when edit‐
              ing. This is useful for files that  you  frequently  cus‐
              tomize manually.

       <<//--ffiilleennaammee##eeAA//>>
              _d_i_r//ffiilleennaammee  will  be  erased,  if the options after the
              ‘‘#’’ are active, in this case _n_o_t _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and _e_d_i_t.

       <<//++ddiirreeccttoorryy##aaII//>>
              The directory ‘‘directory’’ is created if the flags spec‐
              ified  are active, in this case _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.
              If no flags are specified, the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted.

       <<//::lliinnkk//ddiirreeccttoorryy##aaII//>>
              ddoott_-_l_i_n_k is symlinked to _d_i_r_/_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y if the flags spec‐
              ified  are active, in this case _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.
              If no flags are specified, the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted.

       In addition, _l_o_c_a_l is substituted for <<##LL##>>,  the  part  of  _d_o_t
       between  the first 2 hyphens (if any) for <<##11##>>, the part of _d_o_t
       between the second and third hyphen (if any) for <<##22##>>, _h_o_s_t for
       <<##HH##>>,  _d_i_r  for <<##DD##>>, _d_o_t for <<##TT##>>, _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e for <<##CC##>>, the
       set of all active flags for <<##FF##>>,  the  config  file  used  for
       <<##XX##>>,  and the path to the eezzmmllmm binaries for <<##BB##>> anywhere in
       the text. Other tags of this format are copied to the  files  as
       is.

       <<##ll##>>,  <<##hh##>>,  <<##nn##>>, <<##AA##>>, <<##RR##>>, will be substituted on-the-
       fly where appropriate for the _l_o_c_a_l or _l_o_c_a_l--ddiiggeesstt  local  part
       of  the  list  address,  the _h_o_s_t, the subscriber address or the
       moderation accept address, the message number, and the subscrip‐
       tion  reply  address or moderation reject address, respectively.
       The use of <<##ll##>> is to allow the same text file to be  used  for
       requests  pertaining  to both the main list and the digest list.
       <<##hh##>> makes it possible  to  share  some  files  between  lists.
       <<##nn##>>  is  defined only by programs where this makes sense, i.e.
       eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) and eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11))

       In the absence of --ee and --++ switches, eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will create the
       list  directory  before processing the template file, and create
       _d_i_r//kkeeyy after all other actions.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will use  //eettcc//eezzmmllmm//ddeeffaauulltt//eezzmmllmmrrcc.   This  can  be
       overridden with the --cc and --CC switches.

BBUUGGSS
       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee deals with the template file as us-ascii.  Any occur‐
       rence of the characters ‘‘</’’ at the beginning of a  line  will
       disrupt  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  operation.  Any occurrence of tags with the
       format ‘‘<#X#>’’ with with ’X’ being any digit, ’B’,  ’C’,  ’D’,
       ’F’,  ’H’,  ’L’,  or ’T’ will be substituted by eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee.  Any
       occurrence of a tag of this format with ’X’ being ’h’, ’l’, ’A’,
       or  ’R’  will  be substituted by eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree and eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee at
       run time.  eezzmmllmm--sseenndd will substitute tags with ’h’ and ’l’, and
       tags  with  ’n’  will be replaced by the current message number.
       eezzmmllmm--ggeett will substitute tags ‘‘<#h#>’’, ‘‘<#l#>’’ in the  same
       way.  The  tag  ‘‘<#n#>’’ will be replaced by the digest message
       number which is the number of the first message in the digest.

       In practice, these character sequences are unlikely to occur  in
       any  multi-byte  character set text. They also will not occur by
       chance in single-byte character sets where  ’<’,  ’/’,  and  ’#’
       retain their us-ascii codes.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee  cannot  deal with ezmlmrc lines containing NUL (they
       will be truncated at the NUL). This needs to be fixed to make it

       eezzmmllmmrrcc  is  a  file  that  configures eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11)) for setting up new
       lists.  eezzmmllmmrrcc if a plain text with four types of tags. All  start  in
       the  first  position of the line.  No other text is allowed on the same
       line. For security reasons, no periods are allowed anywhere in  a  tag.
       Any  line with a ‘‘#’’ in position 1 is ignored, as is any text preced‐
       ing the first tag.

       The first line in eezzmmllmmrrcc is unique. It should start in position 1 with
       ‘‘x.yz’’,  where  ‘‘x’’ is the major version number, ‘‘y’’ a minor ver‐
       sion number, and ‘‘z’’ a bugfix  version  number.   eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11))  will
       print  a  warning message if it is used with an eezzmmllmmrrcc file that lacks
       the version identifier, or with an eezzmmllmmrrcc  file  that  has  a  version
       identifier  that  differs in either major or minor version numbers from
       the eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee version.

       The eezzmmllmmrrcc file is processed top down. Text preceding the first tag is
       ignored.   Subsequently, one and only one file is open for writing. Any
       text encountered in eezzmmllmmrrcc is copied to that file as  is  with  a  few
       substitutions  (see  below).  Text following conditional tags is copied
       only if the condition is met. A file is automatically closed when a new
       file  is  opened.  Opening  a file overwrites any preexisting file with
       that name.  Tags are:


       <<//ffiilleennaammee##aaII//>>
              The following text will be copied to _d_i_r//ffiilleennaammee if the options
              specified  after the ‘‘#’’ are active, in this case _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and
              not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.  Any number of flags can be specified. This is used
              to  adapt the files and messages to the type of list created. If
              no flags are used, the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted. If the file name is
              the same as the previous tag, or if it is omitted, the text will
              be added to the previous file.  When a new file  is  opened  the
              previous  file is closed. Attempts to add more text to a already
              closed file overwrites its contents.  For  all  letter  switches
              (except --ccCCvvVV), upper and lower case tags are opposite and mutu‐
              ally exclusive. Thus, if --gg is specified, --GG is not set  and  if
              --GG is set, --gg is not.

              The tag ##EE has special meaning. It is false if the list is being
              edited, e.g.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee --ee or ++, but true if  switches  --eeee  or
              --++++  are  used,  or  if eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee _l_o_c_a_l is specified. Thus, for
              normal edits with unchanged list name, the files tagged with  ##EE
              are  not  overwritten (preserving manual customizations), but if
              the list name changes or if explicitly specified by --eeee  or  --++++
              the ##EE switch is ignored.


       <<//ffiilleennaammee##55^^ii//>>
              This is an alternative way of specifying ‘‘if switch -5 is spec‐
              ified and the -i switch is not specified’’.  ‘‘^’’  is  used  as
              ‘‘not’’.

       <<//--ffiilleennaammee##eeAA//>>
              _d_i_r//ffiilleennaammee  will be erased, if the options after the ‘‘#’’ are
              active, in this case _n_o_t _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and _e_d_i_t.  An  alternative  to
              specify  that  a flag, e.g. ‘‘4’’ should not be active is to use
              ‘‘^4’’.

       <<//++ddiirreeccttoorryy##aaII//>>
              The directory ‘‘directory’’ is created if  the  flags  specified
              are  active, in this case _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.  If no flags
              are specified, the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted.

       <<//::lliinnkk//ddiirreeccttoorryy##aaII//>>
              ddoott_-_l_i_n_k is symlinked to _d_i_r_/_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y if  the  flags  specified
              are  active, in this case _a_r_c_h_i_v_e_d and not _i_n_d_e_x_e_d.  If no flags
              are specified, the ‘‘#’’ can be omitted.

       _e_z_m_l_m_-_m_a_k_e substitutes the following tags anywhere  within  files  when
       they  are  (re)created.   Other  tags  of this format are copied to the
       files as is.

       <<##BB##>>  The path to the eezzmmllmm--iiddxx binaries.

       <<##CC##>>  _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e

       <<##DD##>>  _d_i_r

       <<##FF##>>  The  alphanumeric  flags  given   to   _e_z_m_l_m_-_m_a_k_e   concatenated
              together.

       <<##HH##>>  _h_o_s_t

       <<##LL##>>  _l_o_c_a_l

       <<##TT##>>  _d_o_t

       <<##00##>>  The argument for _-_0.

       <<##11##>>  The part of _d_o_t between the first two hyphens (if any).

       <<##22##>>  The part of _d_o_t between the second and third hyphen (if any).

       <<##33##>>..<<##99##>>
              The argument to _-_3.._-_9.

       Before  the template file is processed, eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will create the list
       directory.  eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee will also create _d_i_r//kkeeyy.

       The ezmlmrc file is preconfigured to act upon eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11)) switches to
       produce the results as described in the eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11)) man page.  A num‐
       ber of files are created via eezzmmllmmrrcc  independently  of  any  switches.
       These are _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerraadddd adding ‘‘Precedence: bulk’’ and ‘‘X-No-Archive:
       yes’’ to outgoing messages,  and  _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerrrreemmoovvee  removing  ‘‘Return-
       Path’’,  ‘‘Return-Receipt-To’’,  ‘‘Content-length’’, and ‘‘Precedence’’
       from list messages.  These files are not  overwritten  when  lists  are
       edited.

       _d_i_r//bboouunncceerr  and  _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunncceerr are set up to invoke eezzmmllmm--wweeeedd((11))
       and eezzmmllmm--rreettuurrnn((11)) to handle bounces.  In addition to switch-dependent
       lines,  an invocation of eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn((11)) is placed at the end of _d_i_r//eeddii‐‐
       ttoorr, _d_i_r//mmaannaaggeerr, and _d_i_r//oowwnneerr to process the contents of  the  bounce
       directory.   eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt((11))  is placed first in _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr (unless the
       --00 mmaaiinnlliisstt@@mmaaiinnhhoosstt switch is used) to reject undesirable messages.

       Below is a description of the switches and the  consequences  the  have
       for  list  creation  with  the  standard eezzllmmrrcc file.  eemmzzllmm--mmaakkee((11)) by
       default sets the --aa, and --pp switches.

       --aa     _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivveedd and _d_i_r//iinnddeexxeedd are  created.   _d_i_r//tteexxtt//bboottttoomm  is
              adjusted   to  mention  archive  access.   --AA  _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivveedd  and
              _d_i_r//iinnddeexxeedd are removed.

       --bb     Block archive.  _d_i_r//mmooddggeettoonnllyy is created to allow only  modera‐
              tors archive access.

       --BB     _d_i_r//mmooddggeettoonnllyy is removed.

       --dd     _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstteedd is created, signalling to programs to send digests.

       --DD     _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstteedd is removed, signalling to not send digests.

       --ff     The text ‘‘[_l_o_c_a_l]’’ is placed in _d_i_r//pprreeffiixx  resulting  in  the
              text being used as the list’s subject index.

       --FF     _d_i_r//pprreeffiixx is removed.

       --gg     _d_i_r//ssuubbggeettoonnllyy is created, signalling eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) to only allow
              subscribers to access the archive.

       --GG     _d_i_r//ssuubbggeettoonnllyy is removed, signalling eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11))  That  anyone
              can access the archive if archive (access) in general is enabled
              (see  --pp  for  ‘‘public’’,  --aa  for  ‘‘archived’’,  and  --ii  for
              ‘‘indexed’’.

       --ii     _d_i_r//tthhrreeaaddeedd  is  created  to  signal eezzmmllmm--aarrcchhiivvee((11)) to run as
              appropriate after messages are posted.  This sets up the  cross-
              reference for eezzmmllmm--ccggii((11)) WWW access.

       --II     _d_i_r//tthhrreeaaddeedd is removed.

       --jj     _d_i_r//nnoouunnssuubbccoonnffiirrmm  is  created to signal eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11)) to not
              require confirmation after unsubscription requests.

       --JJ     _d_i_r//nnoouunnssuubbccoonnffiirrmm is removed.

       --ll     _d_i_r//mmooddccaannlliisstt is created to  signal  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11))  to  allow
              retrieval  of subscriber list and list log by remote administra‐
              tors.  NNOOTTEE: This is pointless, unless the list is also  set  up
              for remote administration with the --rr switch.

       --LL     _d_i_r//mmooddccaannlliisstt  is removed, disallowing access to the subscriber
              list under any circumstances.

       --mm     Message  moderation.   _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt  is  created,  which  signals
              eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11))   to  store  messages  and  forward  confirmation
              requests to the moderators.  Special action is taken when the --mm
              switch  is  combined  with --uu.  In this case, the handling is as
              for the --mm switch alone, but _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr is set  up  with  eezzmmllmm--
              ggaattee((11)) which will fork eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) for posts with an envelope
              sender that is a subscriber  or  a  moderator,  and  for  eezzmmllmm--
              ssttoorree((11))  for posts with other envelope senders. The consequence
              is that posts from  subscribers  (with  the  usual  caveats  for
              SENDER checks) are posted directly, whereas other posts are sent
              for moderation.

       --MM     _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt is removed, undoing the changes above.

       --nn     Allow text file editing.  _d_i_r//mmooddccaanneeddiitt is created to signal to
              allow  remote  admins to via E-mail edit the files in _d_i_r//tteexxtt//.
              NNOOTTEE: This is pointless, unless the list  is  also  set  up  for
              remote administration with the --rr switch.

       --NN     _d_i_r//mmooddccaanneeddiitt  is  removed  to  disallow  editing  of  files in
              _d_i_r//tteexxtt.

       --oo     _d_i_r//mmooddppoossttoonnllyy is created to signal  eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11))  ro  reject
              posts from non-moderators on moderated lists rather than sending
              them for moderation. This is for some announcement lists.

       --OO     _d_i_r//mmooddppoossttoonnllyy is removed.

       --pp     Public.  _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc is created, signaling eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) to  allow
              archive  retrieval  attempts,  and eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11)) to allow sub‐
              scription and unsubscription attempts.

       --PP     Not public.  _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc is removed.

       --rr     Remote admin.  _d_i_r//rreemmoottee is created to  signal  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11))
              to allow remote administration of mailing lists.

       --RR     _d_i_r//rreemmoottee is removed.

       --ss     Subscription moderation.  _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb is created to signal eezzmmllmm--
              mmaannaaggee((11)) to forward confirmed subscription requests to the mod‐
              erators  for approval.  The unsubscription process is unchanged.

       --SS     _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb is removed.

       --tt     _d_i_r//aaddddttrraaiilleerr is created to signal eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) to include the
              trailer  portions  in _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ttrraaiilleerr in messages posted to the
              list.

       --TT     _d_i_r//aaddddttrraaiilleerr is removed.

       --uu     Subscriber-only posts.   _d_i_r//ssuubbppoossttoonnllyy  is  created  to  allow
              posts  only  from  subscribers.  eezzmmllmm--cchheecckkssuubb((11)) is checks the
              envelope sender against the subscriber  address  databases.   If
              the  sender  is not found, the post is rejected. This results in
              subscriber-only posts, with the usual caveats for SENDER checks.
              Special  action is taken when the --uu switch is combined with --mm.
              In this case, the setup is as  for  the  --mm  switch  alone,  but
              eezzmmllmm--ggaattee((11)) will execute eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) for posts with an enve‐
              lope sender that is a subscriber or a moderator, and will other‐
              wise  moderate  the message.  The consequence is that posts from
              subscribers (with the  usual  caveats  for  SENDER  checks)  are
              posted  directly,  whereas  other posts are sent for moderation.

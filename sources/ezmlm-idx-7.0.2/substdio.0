       ssuubbssttddiioo is the Sub-Standard I/O Library.  ssuubbssttddiioo contains only a few
       of the features of stdio; it is a fast, lightweight, low-level library,
       suitable for use as a component of higher-level I/O libraries.

       The  point of ssuubbssttddiioo is to provide buffered I/O.  The basic object in
       ssuubbssttddiioo is the ssuubbssttddiioo structure; a ssuubbssttddiioo variable stores an oper‐
       ation,  a  descriptor,  and  a  pointer  into  a buffer of some nonzero
       length.  The ssuubbssttddiioo operations read data from the buffer, filling the
       buffer  as  necessary  using  the operation on the descriptor, or write
       data to the buffer, flushing the buffer as necessary using  the  opera‐
       tion on the descriptor.  Input and output operations cannot be mixed.

       ssuubbssttddiioo__ffddbbuuff  initializes  a ssuubbssttddiioo variable.  The operation is _o_p.
       The descriptor is _f_d.  The buffer is _b_u_f, an array of _l_e_n chars.

       _o_p will be called as _o_p(_f_d,_x,_n).  Here _x is a pointer to  an  array  of
       characters  of  length  _n; _o_p must read some characters from _f_d to that
       array, or write some characters to _f_d  from  that  array.   The  return
       value  from  _o_p  must  be  the number of characters read or written.  0
       characters read means end of input; 0 characters written means that the
       write  operation  should be tried again immediately.  On error, _o_p must
       return -1, setting eerrrrnnoo appropriately, without reading or writing any‐
       thing.   Most  errors are returned directly to the ssuubbssttddiioo caller, but
       an error of eerrrroorr__iinnttrr means that the operation should be  tried  again
       immediately.

       There is a SSUUBBSSTTDDIIOO__FFDDBBUUFF macro that can be used to statically initial‐
       ize a ssuubbssttddiioo variable:

          substdio s = SUBSTDIO_FDBUF(op,fd,buf,len);

       ssuubbssttddiioo__ffiilleennoo returns the  descriptor  for  an  initialized  ssuubbssttddiioo
       variable.

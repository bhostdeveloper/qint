DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee reads a mail message, expecting it to contain an _-_a_c_c_e_p_t
       or _-_r_e_j_e_c_t action request for the mailing list stored in _d_i_r_.

       eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee verifies the cookie sent as part of the action  request,
       and   if   correct  attempts  to  find  the  corresponding  message  in
       _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//.  If the message is found, it is  either  rejected  or
       posted to the list, depending on the action request.

       Posts  to  the  list are handled by piping the message to eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11))
       located in the ezmlm binary directory, as set at compile time. This  is
       usually the directory that ezmlm-moderate resides in.  eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)) is
       provided with _d_i_r as the first argument.

       If the optional second argument is given, eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee pipes the mes‐
       sage to that program.  No additional parameters are supplied.

       _d_i_r  is  passed as an argument to eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)), but NOT to any program
       specified as the optional eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee command line argument.

       eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee does not bother to correctly set sender.   eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11))
       doesn’t  care,  and  any other program that might be used can parse the
       sender from the first line of the message, which is always _R_e_t_u_r_n_-_P_a_t_h_:
       _<_a_d_d_r_e_s_s_@_h_o_s_t_._d_o_m_a_i_n_>  as build from SENDER originally passed to eezzmmllmm--
       ssttoorree((11)).

       If the message is rejected, an optional  moderator  comment  is  copied
       into  the  notification  to the message sender.  A moderator comment is
       any text in the _-_r_e_j_e_c_t request found between two  lines  with  ‘‘%%%’’
       starting in one of the first 5 positions of the line. The easiest is to
       use lines consisting of ‘‘%%%’’ only. If the characters preceeding  the
       ‘‘%%%’’ are found at the beginning of any lines within the comment, the
       characters are removed. This is to  appropriately  ignore  any  ‘‘quote
       marks’’  that you mail program might place at the beginning of lines in
       a reply.

       eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee messages are sent ‘‘From:’’  _l_i_s_t_-_o_w_n_e_r_@_l_i_s_t_h_o_s_t.   This
       allows  the poster to easily complain to the owner of the list, in case
       s/he objects. An optional ‘‘Reply-To:’’ header can  be  added  via  the
       --rr _r_e_p_l_y_-_t_o_@_h_o_s_t.

       Once  the  message  has  been  successfully accepted or rejected, it is
       removed   from   _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//   and   a   stub   is   created    in
       _d_i_r//mmoodd//aacccceepptteedd//  or _d_i_r//mmoodd//rreejjeecctteedd//, respectively.  This is done in
       order to be able to notify the senders  of  later  moderation  requests
       about the fate of the message.

       A  failure to find the message in _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg// is most often caused
       by the message already having been accepted or rejected by another mod‐
       erator.   Therefore,  eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee  looks  in  _d_i_r//mmoodd//aacccceepptteedd//  and
       _d_i_r//mmoodd//rreejjeecctteedd// for a message stub. If found, eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee notifies
       the  sender in the form of a fatal error if the fate of the message was
       different from that intended by the current action request.  Otherwise,
       the fate of the message is silently logged.

       If  the  message  is not found, it has timed out and the message or the
       message stub has been removed by eezzmmllmm--cclleeaann((11)).  In this case,  eezzmmllmm--
       mmooddeerraattee  notifies the moderator of the failure, but can no longer dis‐
       cern the fate of the original message. Again, notification  is  in  the
       form of a fatal error from qmail.

       At  the  beginning of the message, eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee prints a new MMaaiilliinngg--
       LLiisstt field with the  contents  of  the  _T_X_T___M_A_I_L_I_N_G___L_I_S_T  message.   It
       rejects the message if there is already a MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt field.

       eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee  does not distribute bounce messages: if the environment
       variable SSEENNDDEERR is set, and is either  empty  or  ##@@[[]],  eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee
       rejects the message.

       If _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett exists, eezzmmllmm--mmooddeerraattee will use the character set listed
       for all messages. Otherwise, the default ‘‘us-ascii’’ will be used. The
       character set can be suffixed by ‘‘:’’ followed by a code. If the  code
       is  ‘‘Q’’, outgoing messages are sent as ‘‘Quoted-Printable’’, if it is
       ‘‘B’’ they are sent ‘‘base64’’ encoded.  Otherwise, text is sent as is.

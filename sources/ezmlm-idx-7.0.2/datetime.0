       International  Atomic  Time, TAI, is the fundamental unit for time mea‐
       surements.  TAI has one label for every second of  real  time,  without
       complications such as leap seconds.

       A struct datetime variable, such as _d_t, stores a TAI label.  _d_t..yyeeaarr is
       the year number minus 1900; _d_t..mmoonn is the month number,  from  0  (Jan‐
       uary)  through  11  (December); _d_t..mmddaayy is the day of the month, from 1
       through 31; _d_t..hhoouurr is the hour, from  0  through  23;  _d_t..mmiinn  is  the
       minute,  from  0  through  59; _d_t..sseecc is the second, from 0 through 59;
       _d_t..wwddaayy is the day of the week, from 0 (Sunday) through  6  (Saturday);
       _d_t..yyddaayy is the day of the year, from 0 through 365.

       The ddaatteettiimmee library supports more convenient TAI manipulation with the
       datetime_sec type.  A datetime_sec value, such  as  _t,  is  an  integer
       referring to the _tth second after the beginning of 1970 TAI.  The first
       second of 1970 TAI was 0; the next second was 1;  the  last  second  of
       1969  TAI  was -1.  The difference between two datetime_sec values is a
       number of real-time seconds.

       ddaatteettiimmee__ttaaii converts a datetime_sec to a TAI label.

       ddaatteettiimmee__uunnttaaii  reads  a  TAI  label  (specifically  _d_t..yyeeaarr,   _d_t..mmoonn,
       _d_t..mmddaayy, _d_t..hhoouurr, _d_t..mmiinn, and _d_t..sseecc) and returns a datetime_sec.

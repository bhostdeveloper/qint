DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  handles  administrative  requests  for  the  mailing list
       stored in _d_i_r, as well as for the associated digest list.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee is normally invoked from a ..qqmmaaiill file.  It reads  a  mail
       message  from  its standard input, and a mail envelope from the SSEENNDDEERR,
       LLOOCCAALL, DDEEFFAAUULLTT, and HHOOSSTT environment variables.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee expects DDEEFFAAUULLTT to be of the form _a_c_t_i_o_n--_b_o_x==_d_o_m_a_i_n.  Here
       _a_c_t_i_o_n  is  a  request,  and  _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n  is the target of the request.
       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee sends a response to the target.  It attaches the  original
       message to the end of its response.

       DDEEFFAAUULLTT  may instead be of the (simple) form _a_c_t_i_o_n.  Then the envelope
       sender is used as the target.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n starts with ‘‘digest’’, the request is assumed to be for  the
       associated digest list.  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee handles these requests similarly,
       except  that  digest  list   subscriber   addresses   are   stored   in
       _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstt//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss, rather than in _d_i_r//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss.

       If  _a_c_t_i_o_n  starts with ‘‘allow’’, the request is assumed to be for the
       associated _d_i_r//aallllooww// database. This database is used to store  aliases
       of  subscribers  for  lists  allowing  only  posts only if the envelope
       sender is a subscriber.  Actions on the _d_i_r//aallllooww// database follow  the
       same  rules  as  for  the main list. The ezmlm messages are the same as
       those used for normal subscription, but refer  to  the  _l_i_s_t--aallllooww@@_h_o_s_t
       list. As this feature is designed for advanced uses and remote adminis‐
       trators only, this is not a problem.  NNOOTTEE:: No message is sent  out  to
       confirm  additions to or removals from this database. However, the user
       can verify the change using the _q_u_e_r_y action.  If  _a_c_t_i_o_n  starts  with
       ‘‘deny’’,  the  command  is applied simiparly to the _d_i_r//ddeennyy// database
       for blocking posts with certain envelope  senders.   This  database  is
       available  to remote administrators only, and only if the list has been
       set up with this feature (see eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11))).  NNOOTTEE::  No  message  is
       sent  out to confirm additions to or removals from this database.  How‐
       ever, the remote admin can verify the change using the _q_u_e_r_y action.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee copies the _T_X_T___M_A_I_L_I_N_G___L_I_S_T message  into  a  MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt
       field  in  its  response.   If  the incoming message has a MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt
       field, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee refuses to respond.  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee also  refuses  to
       respond to bounce messages.

       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  reads  _d_i_r//ccooppyylliinneess  to  determine how many lines of the
       original message to copy into the outgoing message.  If  this  file  is
       empty  or  not present, a value of _0 is presumed, meaning that only the
       header is copied.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb   (Default.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will add  general  instructions  and  the
            request to the outgoing message.

       --BB   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  will not add general instructions and the request to
            the outgoing message.  This information gives the recipient  of  a
            confirmation  request some information about the inciting message.
            Use of this switch will deny the recipient that information.

       --cc   (Default.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will reply to _-_g_e_t commands.

       --CC   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will not reply to _-_g_e_t commands. This is  useful  for
            closed  lists,  where  the  owner for some reason wants to keep an
            archive, without making it available.

       --dd   Alias for the --ee switch for backwards compatibility.

       --DD   Alias for the --EE switch for backwards compatibility.

       --ee   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  allows  remote  administrators  to  edit  files   in
            _d_i_r//tteexxtt// via E-mail.

       --EE   (Default.)   Text  file  editing not allowed.  This is the default
            unless the _d_i_r//mmooddccaanneeddiitt file exists.

       --ff   (Default.)  The information in the  ‘‘From:’’  is  extracted  from
            subscribe  confirm messages and added to _d_i_r//LLoogg together with the
            subscriber address. This makes it easier for  the  list  owner  to
            help  a  subscriber  who  cannot  determine  his/her  subscription
            address. If the --SS switch is  used,  the  information  is  instead
            extracted from the subscribe request.

       --FF   Ignore ‘‘From:’’ headers.

       --ll   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  will  send  a  subscriber list in reply to the _-_l_i_s_t
            command and the number of subscribers in reply to the _-_l_i_s_t_n  com‐
            man  if _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb or _d_i_r//rreemmoottee exist and target (the address the
            reply is to be sent to) is a moderator.

       --LL   (Default.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will ignore the  _-_l_i_s_t  and  _-_l_i_s_t_n  com‐
            mands.  This is the default unless the _d_i_r//mmooddccaannlliisstt file exists.

       --mm   For lists with moderated subscription, require moderator  approval
            also for unsubscribe requests. Remote admins are normally informed
            about unsuccessful unsubscribes. This creates problems when  there
            is more than one moderator. Therefore, when the --mm switch is used,
            the notification is suppressed. Moderators can still determine the
            result by using the _-_q_u_e_r_y command.

       --MM   (Default.)   Requests  to  unsubscribe from moderated lists do not
            require moderator approval.

       --nn   (Default.)  Target addresses will be notified if the are added  or
            removed from the subscriber list.

       --NN   Target  addresses  will  not be notified if they are added/removed
            from the subscriber list by  remote  admin  or  moderator  action.
            Also,  the  target  will not be notified if they were successfully
            added/removed when the --SS and --UU switches, respectively, are used.

       --qq   (Default.)   Quiet. The list-owner is not notified of subscription
            events.

       --QQ   The list-owner is notified about failed unsubscribe attempts. Usu‐
            ally,  these  are from subscribers that do not remember their sub‐
            scription address and require  administrative  assistance.  Remote
            admins  are  notified when a unsubscribe request initiated by them
            fails. Thus, the owner is not notified about these events even  if
            the --QQ switch is used.

       --QQQQ  As  for  --QQ, and in addition, the list-owner is notified about all
            additions to or removals from the  subscriber  database.  This  is
            sometimes desired by owners of small lists.

       --ss   (Default.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will handle subscriptions with the normal
            target handshake.  This is the default unless the _d_i_r//nnoossuubbccoonnffiirrmm
            file exists.

       --SS   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  will  eliminate  the  target handshake from the sub‐
            scription process. This allows anyone to subscribe  anybody  else.
            DO  NOT  use this option, unless you know what you are doing. This
            option may be useful for some moderated lists.

       --uu   (Default.)  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will handle unsubscribe requests with the
            normal target handshake.  This is the default unless the _d_i_r//nnoouunn‐‐
            ssuubbccoonnffiirrmm file exists.

       --UU   eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will eliminate the target handshake from  the  unsub‐
            scription process. This allows anyone to unsubscribe anybody else.
            DO NOT use this option, unless you know what you are doing.

CCHHAARRAACCTTEERR SSEETTSS
       If _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett exists, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will use the character  set  listed
       for all messages. Otherwise, the default ‘‘us-ascii’’ will be used. The
       character set can be suffixed by ‘‘:’’ followed by a code. If the  code
       is  ‘‘Q’’, outgoing messages are sent as ‘‘Quoted-Printable’’, if it is
       ‘‘B’’ they are sent ‘‘base64’’ encoded.  Otherwise, text is sent as is.

       Incoming text for the _-_e_d_i_t is accepted unencoded or in either of these
       encodings.

SSUUBBSSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONNSS
       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is sscc.._c_o_o_k_i_e, where _c_o_o_k_i_e is an appropriate code  (depending
       on  the  target, the approximate time, and other factors), eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee
       adds the target to the mailing list if subscriptions are not moderated.
       For  subscription  moderated  lists,  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee sends a confirmation
       request to the moderators with  the  right  ttcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e  address  in  its
       response.

       If  _a_c_t_i_o_n  is  rrcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e  or ttcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e, where _c_o_o_k_i_e is an appropriate
       code (depending on the target, the approximate  time,  and  other  fac‐
       tors),  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee adds the target to the mailing list. If the target
       was not already a subscriber, a welcome message is sent to the  target.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is ssuubbssccrriibbee, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee does not subscribe the target, but
       it identifies the right sscc.._c_o_o_k_i_e address in its response.

       This confirmation mechanism (1) verifies that the target  is  reachable
       and (2) protects the target against forged subscription requests.

       Actions of uucc.._c_o_o_k_i_e and uunnssuubbssccrriibbee are used in the same way to delete
       the target from the mailing list.  Unsubscribes do not require  modera‐
       tor  confirmation  unless the --mm option is given.  Actions of vvcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e
       are used for moderator confirmation of unsubscribes.

       Actions of rrcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e are used to confirm  moderator-iniated  subscribes
       for lists configured with remote administration (see MODERATION).

       Actions  of  wwcc.._c_o_o_k_i_e  are  used to confirm moderator-initiated unsub‐
       scribes for lists configured with remote  administration  (see  MODERA‐
       TION).

       If  _a_c_t_i_o_n is qquueerryy, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee returns a message to the target indi‐
       cating whether or not the target address is a subscriber.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n  is  iinnffoo  or  ffaaqq,  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  returns  the  contents  of
       _d_i_r//tteexxtt//iinnffoo or _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ffaaqq, respectively.

       If _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc does not exist, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee rejects all subscription and
       unsubscription attempts.  However,  if  the  list  is  configured  with
       remote  administration,  moderator-initiated  subscribe and unsubscribe
       requests will still be honored. Also, if _a_c_t_i_o_n is  _h_e_l_p,  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee
       will still send help.

TTEEXXTT FFIILLEE EEDDIITTIINNGG
       If  _a_c_t_i_o_n  is eeddiitt, either the --ee switch is used or the _d_i_r//mmooddccaanneeddiitt
       file exists, and the target address is that of a remote  administrator,
       eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  will  reply with a list of editable file in _d_i_r//tteexxtt// and
       instructions for editing. Cookies for editing expire approximately 27.8
       hours after they are issued, or when a file has been changed, whichever
       is sooner. The size of the updated file is limited to 5120 bytes.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is eeddiitt.._f_i_l_e, the --ee switch is used, and the  target  address
       is that of a remote administrator, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will return an editable
       copy of _f_i_l_e.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is eedd.._c_o_o_k_i_e, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will verify that the  edit  cookie
       is still valid and that the file has not been modified since the cookie
       was issued. If the cookie passes these tests, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will  update
       _d_i_r//tteexxtt_/_f_i_l_e.

AARRCCHHIIVVEE RREETTRRIIEEVVAALLSS
       If  _a_c_t_i_o_n  is  ggeett.._n_u_m,  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  sends  back  message  _n_u_m  from
       _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivvee//.  This can be disabled with the --CC command line switch.

       If  _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc  does  not  exist,  eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee  rejects  all   archive

MMOODDEERRAATTIIOONN
       If  _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb  exists,  subscriptions  are moderated. Users can unsub‐
       scribe without moderator action, but moderator confirmation is required
       for subscriptions.

       If  _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb is not empty, it is assumed that the content this is the
       base directory for the moderator database ( _m_o_d_d_i_r).  Otherwise, _m_o_d_d_i_r
       is assumed to be _d_i_r//mmoodd//.  The given path must either be within _d_i_r or
       a relative directory name.

       The moderator names are assumed to be stored in a set of files in  _m_o_d_‐
       _d_i_r//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//.

       Subscription  requests  from  potential  subscribers will be sent for a
       second round of confirmation to all the  moderators.   If  a  moderator
       approves  the  request,  a  message confirming the subscription will be
       sent to the subscriber. The subscriber will not  know  which  moderator
       approved the subscription.

       If  more  than  one  moderator replies to the confirmation request, the
       subscriber will not receive duplicate messages about being on  (or  not
       on) the mailing list.

       Unsubscribe requests from users are handled as for non-moderated lists.

       All subscribe confirmation requests requiring moderator action  have  a
       subject of CCOONNFFIIRRMM ssuubbssccrriibbee ttoo _l_i_s_t_n_a_m_e_@_h_o_s_t_.  All unsubscribe confir‐
       mation requests in reply  to  moderator-initiated  unsubscribe  dialogs
       have a subject of CCOONNFFIIRRMM uunnssuubbssccrriibbee ffrroomm _l_i_s_t_n_a_m_e_@_h_o_s_t_.

       If _d_i_r//rreemmoottee exists (remote administration), moderators can initiate a
       request to subscribe a user  ’username@userhost’  by  sending  mail  to
       _l_i_s_t_n_a_m_e_-_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e--uusseerrnnaammee==uusseerrhhoosstt_@_h_o_s_t.  The moderator (not the sub‐
       scriber) will receive the confirmation request, and  can  complete  the
       transaction. Moderators’ request to unsubscribe users are handled anal‐
       ogously. Once an address is successfully added to or removed  from  the
       subscriber  database  by a moderator or remote admin, the user is noti‐
       fied of the action. If a moderator or remote admin’s subscribe  confir‐
       mation  does  not result in a change, i.e. if the address already was a
       subscriber, no notification is sent. If a  remote  admin’s  unsubscribe
       confirmation  does  not  result in a change, i.e. the address was not a
       subscriber, a notification is sent to the remote admin. This is to make
       the remote admin aware that the address unsubscribed most likely is not
       the subscriber’s subscription address.

       _d_i_r//rreemmoottee is not empty, it is assumed that the  content  this  is  the
       base  directory  for  the  moderator database ( _m_o_d_d_i_r).  The moderator
       names are assumed to be  stored  in  a  set  of  files  in  _m_o_d_d_i_r//ssuubb‐‐
       ssccrriibbeerrss//.   The  given  path  must  either be within _d_i_r or a relative
       directory name.  If both _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb and _d_i_r//rreemmoottee exist, and both con‐
       tain directory names, the directory name in _d_i_r//mmooddssuubb is used, and the
       _d_i_r//rreemmoottee entry is ignored.

       It is possible to set up a mailinglist for  moderators  only  by  using
       _d_i_r//mmoodd//  as the list directory. Make sure that such a list is not pub‐
       lic! Otherwise, anyone can become a moderator by  subscribing  to  this
       list.

       If  action  is  --hheellpp  and  target is a moderator, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will in
       addition to the usual help send _d_i_r//tteexxtt//mmoodd--hheellpp  containing  instruc‐
       tions for moderators.

       If  action  is  --lliisstt and target is a moderator, the list is set up for
       subscription moderation or remote administration, and  the  _-_l  command
       line  switch  is  used  or the _d_i_r//mmooddccaannlliisstt file exists, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee
       will reply with an unsorted subscriber list. Extensions for digest sub‐
       scribers and auxillary databases are supported (see above).

       If action is --lloogg, eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee will reply with the contents of the _L_o_g
       file with the same access restrictions as for the --lliisstt action.

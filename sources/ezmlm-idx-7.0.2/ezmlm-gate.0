       eezzmmllmm--ggaattee checks if SENDER is in it least one of the subscriber  lists
       with base directory _d_i_r/_m_o_d_s_u_b_d_i_r_1, _d_i_r/_m_o_d_s_u_b_d_i_r_2, etc.  If it is, the
       message is posted via eezzmmllmm--sseenndd to the list in _d_i_r.  If not, the  mes‐
       sage is sent for moderation via eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree.  The named subscriber list
       directories must be either relative to _d_i_r or fall within _d_i_r.

       The default is to send the message for moderation.

              Execute arbitration programs in _f_i_l_e.  Lines in  _f_i_l_e  are  exe‐
              cuted just like in regular _._q_m_a_i_l files with the difference that
              all lines are assumed to be  program  names.  See  ddoott--qqmmaaiill((55)).
              Programs  are executed by /bin/sh and the message is on stdin of
              the executed program.  The leading ‘‘|’’ is  optional.  Comments
              and blank lines are allowed. If a program exits 111, delivery is
              deferred. If it exits 99, the message is sent to the list. If it
              exits  0,  the next line is executed. If it exits with any other
              exit code, the message is sent for moderation. Subscriber status
              per  _m_o_d_s_u_b_d_i_r_1, _m_o_d_s_u_b_d_i_r_2, etc, is tested only if all the pro‐
              grams have been executed and the final exit  code  is  0.  Thus,
              programs  can cause moderation (100), posting (99), or defer the
              decision to the next program and ultimately to  subscriber  sta‐
              tus.

UUSSAAGGEE
       eezzmmllmm--ggaattee is best used if you want to  restrict  posts  to  a  set  of
       addresses  using  SENDER  checks. Obviously, this is not secure, but it
       can help quite a bit to keep garbage off  the  list.  For  more  secure
       setups, see eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11)).  For other arbitration such as SPAM protec‐
       tion, use the --qq option. For instance,  invoking  eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt((11))  here
       would  cause  failing  messages  to  be sent for moderation rather that
       being rejected.

       Set up the list with a eezzmmllmm--ggaattee line in _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr and touch _d_i_r//mmoodd‐‐
       ppoosstt.  Add the moderator(s) (usually the list owner):

       eezzmmllmm--ssuubb _d_i_r mmoodd moderator@host

       This  will via eezzmmllmm--sseenndd directly distribute all posts from subscriber
       addresses and send out the rest for moderation to the moderator(s)  via
       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree.   To  test several subscriber databases, e.g. the list and
       the list-digest subscribers, add the corresponding list directories  to
       the eezzmmllmm--ggaattee command line.

       This  can  be  expanded to include users that post from addresses other
       than the one they are subscribed  as:  just  create  another  directory
       ’addl’,  and  a ’subscribers’ subdirectory of it, and add ’addl’ to the
       eezzmmllmm--ggaattee command line. Now just add  all  problem  addresses  to  the
       ’addl’ address database using eezzmmllmm--ssuubb.  The entire point is that post
       from subscribers of any union of list go through, posts from identified
       ’aliases’  go through and all others go for approval to the list owner.
       Thus, legitimate users are never rejected and ’aliases’ rapidly identi‐
       fied by the owner/moderator and their handling automated one by one, by
       simply adding them to ’addl’.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt  reads a mail message from its standard input.  It rejects
       the message if it sees something it doesn’t like.

       If the message has either a ‘‘Precedence:  junk’’  or  a  ‘‘Precedence:
       bulk’’ header, eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt exits 99 causing the message to be ignored.
       This causes replies from (some) vacation programs to be ignored.

       If _d_i_r is specified, eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt reads _d_i_r//mmssggssiizzee for a maximum:mini‐
       mum  message  body size in bytes. Either number will be ignored if 0 or
       omitted.  eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt will also look  for  _d_i_r//mmiimmeerreejjeecctt  and  either
       _d_i_r//mmiimmeekkeeeepp  or _d_i_r//mmiimmeerreemmoovvee.  If _d_i_r//mmiimmeerreejjeecctt exists, Messages of
       the Content-Types specified or with MIME parts of these types  will  be
       rejected.  If _d_i_r//mmiimmeekkeeeepp exists, eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt will reject messages of
       Content-Types other than what is specified.  Otherwise  if  _d_i_r//mmiimmeerree‐‐
       mmoovvee  exists,  eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt  will  reject messages of the Content-Types
       specified. These content-types will be accepted as parts of a composite
       MIME message. They will be stripped out later by eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)).

       eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt  will  exit  100  (permanent error) for rejections. If the
       list address is not in the message ‘‘To:’’ or ‘‘Cc:’’ headers  and  the
       --tt  switch  is  active, the exit code is 100 or 99, depending on the --qq
       switch (see below).  If you would like to forward messages  instead  of
       rejecting them, you can into the appropriate .qmail file put:

            |condredirect newaddress except /path/ezmlm-reject DIR

       Now  rejected posts will go to this address, and the recipient can take
       appropriate action.

       eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt reads _d_i_r//ccooppyylliinneess to determine how  many  lines  of  the
       original  message  to  copy into the outgoing message.  If this file is
       empty or not present, a value of _0 is presumed, meaning that  only  the
       header is copied.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb     Reject  the  message if the message body starts ‘‘subscribe’’ or
              ‘‘unsubscribe’’. If the --cc switch is  specified,  messages  will
              also be rejected if the subject starts with these words.

       --BB     (Default.)   Do  not  reject  messages starting ‘‘subscribe’’ or
              ‘‘unsubscribe’’.

       --cc     (Default.)  Commands are not permitted in the Subject  line.   A
              Subject  line  consisting  solely of HELP, REMOVE, SUBSCRIBE, or
              UNSUBSCRIBE is rejected.

       --CC     Commands are permitted in the subject line.

       --ff     Forward all messages having a command as the subject line to the
              list’s  -request address for processing.  This is only effective
              if --cc is also set.

       --FF     (Default.)  Do not forward command messages.

       --hh     Reject message if any of the headers in  _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerrrreejjeecctt  occur
              in  the  header.  Mailing-List  headers  of  other  mailing list
              managers can be put into this file, one  per  line,  to  prevent
              processing  of  messages  from other mailing lists.  _d_i_r must be
              specified.

              A reasonable set of headers would be: ‘‘Mailing-List’’,  ‘‘X-ml-
              name’’,  `‘ml-name’’,‘‘X-loop’’,‘‘X-listprocessor-version’’,‘‘X-
              mailing-list’’. Case is not important.

       --HH     (Default.)  Ignore _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerrrreejjeecctt.  --qq Quiet. If  the  message
              due  to  the  lack of the list address (see --tt) is not accepted,
              this is logged but no error message is sent to the sender.

       --qq     Quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list address (see --tt)
              is not accepted, the message is silently ignored.

       --QQ     (Default.)   Not quiet. If a message due to the lack of the list
              address (see --tt) is not accepted, the sender is notified  by  an
              error message.

       --ss     (Default.)  A nonempty Subject line is required.

       --SS     A Subject line is not required.

       --tt     (Default.)  Reject messages that do not have the list address in
              the ‘‘To:’’ or ‘‘Cc:’’ header(s).  eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt needs access  to
              _d_i_r//oouutthhoosstt  and  _d_i_r//oouuttllooccaall  to  check  this.  This  check is
              silently omitted if _d_i_r is not specified,  to  assure  backwards
              compatibility with existing ezmlm lists.

       --TT     Do  not  require  the  list  address  in  the ‘‘To:’’ or ‘‘Cc:’’
              header(s).

BBUUGGSS
       eezzmmllmm--rreejjeecctt does not handle rfc822 comments in ‘‘Content-Type:’’ lines
       if  present  before the type or boundary.  This could be used to defeat
       the MIME rejection function.  OTOH, this function is intended to reduce
       garbage, not guarantee its elimination.

       Since the MIME parser doesn’t decode inner MIME layers of a _m_u_l_t_i_p_a_r_t_/_*
       message, _m_i_m_e_r_e_m_o_v_e and _m_i_m_e_r_e_j_e_c_t will be applied to  the  outer  MIME
       layer only.

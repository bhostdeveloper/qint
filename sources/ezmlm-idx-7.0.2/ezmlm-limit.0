       ezmlm-limit - Limits traffic to list

       eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt [ --ff _f_i_l_e ][ --ddDDFF ][ --tt _s_e_c_s ][ --nn _m_s_g_s ] _d_i_r

       eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt  is  intended to limit traffic to a list in case an outside
       source sends excessive messages. Traffic is limited by  converting  the
       list to a message moderated list, or by deferring messages.

       eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt reads _d_i_r//llooooppnnuumm.  If it does not exist or contains a time
       stamp more than _s_e_c_s seconds old, it is updated.  If  it  exists,  con‐
       tains  a  time  stamp  less than _s_e_c_s seconds old, and _m_s_g_s messages or
       more have passed since _d_i_r//llooooppnnuumm  was  created,  eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt  creates
       _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt.   For  lists  set  up  with eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11)) this results in
       future messages being moderated.

       As long as _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt does not exist, eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree((11)) will simply  for‐
       ward  the  message to eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)).  Once _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt exists, messages
       will be queued for moderation. Thus, in case of error (such as  miscon‐
       figured  auto  responders) subscribers are spared messages in excess of
       the limit. However, no messages are lost, since  the  moderator(s)  can
       (selectively) approve queued messages.

       If _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt already exists, eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt will not take any action.

       Resetting the list requires manual removal of _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt.  Queued mes‐
       sages can be managed with regular moderation or approved in  bulk  with
       eezzmmllmm--aacccceepptt((11)).

       eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt  is  not  required  for normal lists, since qmail and ezmlm
       loop detection prevent problems caused by regular bounces. However,  it
       affords some protection against malice, and severely misconfigured sub‐
       scribers.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --dd     Defer excess traffic. Excess messages  are  deferred  and  qmail
              will  re-deliver. As a consequence, traffic will be throttled to
              the maximum allowed. Due to qmail  delivery  back-off,  messages
              may  not  be  disseminated  in the order received. If traffic is
              continuously above or close to the limit, some messages  may  be
              delayed for a long time or even bounced.

       --DD     (Default.)   Make  the  list  moderated  once  excess traffic is
              detected. This requires the list to be configured up with eezzmmllmm--
              ssttoorree((11))  rather  than  eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)),  which is easiest done by
              first creating a message moderated list, then removing  _d_i_r//mmoodd‐‐
              ppoosstt.

       --nn _m_s_g_s
              Trigger after _m_s_g_s messages (default 30).

       --ff _f_i_l_e
              Instead  of  _d_i_r//llooooppnnuumm use _f_i_l_e as the time stamp. This allows
              the use of multiple instances of eezzmmllmm--lliimmiitt for the same  list.
              For  instance,  you  may  allow  60  messages  per hour with one
              instance and 150 messages per day with another. If _f_i_l_e is rela‐
              tive, this is relative to _d_i_r.

       --FF     (Default.)  Use _d_i_r//llooooppnnuumm as the time stamp.

       --tt _s_e_c_s
              Check  the  number  of  messages  within  period of _s_e_c_s seconds
              (default 3600 seconds).

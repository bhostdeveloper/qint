       eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  is  a very restrictive interface to ccrroonndd((88)).  It edits the
       effective user’s ~/crontab (see  crontab(5))  file.  It  then  executes
       ccrroonnttaabb((11)) to update crond(8) with the changes.

       eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  sets up the generation of trigger messages to the list _l_i_s_‐
       _t_a_d_r and the digest code _c_o_d_e.  A optional digest  format  specifier  _f
       can be added to _c_o_d_e.

       eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  reads  _d_i_r//eezzccrroonnrrcc, where _d_i_r is the home directory of the
       effective user. The first line of this file is the host  name,  ’host’,
       to which bounces should be sent. Any bounces for lists set up by ’user’
       will go to ’user@host’. Subsequent lines are entries for users made  up
       of:  _u_s_e_r_:_l_o_c_a_l_:_h_o_s_t_:_n_u_m_:_[_l_i_s_t_1_[_,_l_i_s_t_2_._._._]_].  The ’:’-separated parame‐
       ters are:

       _u_s_e_r   the user name to which this line corresponds.

       _l_o_c_a_l  the list address must start with exactly these characters  (case
              sensitive).   If  this field is empty, any list local address is
              allowed.

       _h_o_s_t   the list host name  must  exactly  match  this  parameter  (case
              insensitive).   If this field is empty, any list host address is
              allowed. (Host names for the list and the digest list must still
              match.)

       _n_u_m    the user is permitted a maximum of _n_u_m entries.

       _l_i_s_t_1 _[_,_l_i_s_t_2_._._._]
              a  set  of complete list names separated by commas. The user may
              edit entries for these lists, even if they do not match the cri‐
              teria  set  above.  If  these  lists  exist, they are counted in
              determining _n_u_m.  No while space is allowed  before  or  between
              list names. If no list names are specified, the final ’:’ can be
              omitted.

              The first line matching the executing user will be used.

              If eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn is installed SUID  _e_u_s_e_r,  the  configuration  and
              crontab  files  from that user’s home directory will be used for
              all eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn actions. This way, users on a system can be given
              limited   ccrroonndd((88))   access   via   eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn   restricted   by
              _d_i_r//eezzccrroonnrrcc and to the generation of digest  trigger  messages.
              This  is  especially  useful  for  users without shell access or
              access to ccrroonndd((88)).   _e_u_s_e_r  is  usually  ’ezmlm’.   To  install
              eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn SUID ezmlm:

                # chown ezmlm /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-cron
                # chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlm-cron

              eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  refuses  to  run if installed SUID root.  eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn
              when executed by ’root’, will still use the files in ~root.

              To allow ccrroonndd((88)) access, you may need  to  list  the  effective
              user  (all  users  allowed  access  or  ~ezmlm  if eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn is
              installed SUID ezmlm) in //eettcc//ccrroonn..aallllooww.   See  ccrroonnttaabb((11))  for
              further information.

       The --cc, --dd, and --ll switches are mutually exclusive.


       --cc     List user entry from _e_z_c_r_o_n_r_c.

       --CC     (Default.)  Do not list user entry.

       --dd     Delete  entry.   eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  will  search  _~_e_u_s_e_r//ccrroonnttaabb for an
              entry  belonging   to   the   executing   user,   permitted   by
              _~_e_u_s_e_r//eezzccrroonnrrcc  and  matching  the  command line arguments sup‐
              plied.  _c_o_d_e is ignored and may be omitted.

       --DD     (Default.)  Do not delete entry.

       --ii _h_r_s Generate trigger  message  with  _h_r_s  hours  interval.  Accepted
              intervals  are  0,  1 ,2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours.  Other
              numbers  will  be  silently  adjusted  upwards  to  the  nearest
              accepted  interval  (intervals  above  72  hours  will result in
              weekly trigger messages).

       --ll     List entries. If no other  command  line  arguments  are  given,
              eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn lists the entries created in the name of the user. If
              _l_i_s_t_a_d_r is given, eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn will list the entries for  all  the
              matching  lists, even if the entries were not set up by the cur‐
              rent user. Arguments, if given, still have to  comply  with  the
              rules set in _e_z_c_r_o_n_r_c.

              Crude  ccrroonnttaabb((55))  lines  are  listed.  These are taken from the
              ~/crontab file. Usually, these are active entries,  although  if
              the last execution of ccrroonnttaabb((11)) failed, they may not be.

       --LL     (Default.)  Do not list entry.

       --tt _h_h_:_m_m
              The time for the trigger message. Other trigger messages will be
              sent _h_r_s hours before and after this time.

       --ww _d_o_w The days of the week on which trigger messages are sent.  day  0
              and  7 are Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc (see crontab(5)). The string
              specified for _d_o_w must consists of single comma-separated digits
              in  the range ’0’-’7’ only. The default is every day, except for
              _h_r_s of 48 (default Monday, Wednesday, Friday), 72 (default  Mon‐
              day  and  Thursday),  or greater than 72 (default Monday).  Both
              _h_r_s and _d_o_w can be specified. In this case, trigger messages are
              sent  on  the  day specified by _d_o_w at the interval specified by
              _h_r_s.  If _h_r_s is greater than 24 h, it  is  ignored  and  trigger
              messages are generated daily or as specified by _d_o_w.

FFIILLEESS
       _~_e_u_s_e_r_/_e_z_c_r_o_n_r_c
              The  configuration  file for eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn.  _e_u_s_e_r is the effective
              user id. This  is  the  executing  user,  unless  eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn  is
              installed SUID _o_t_h_e_r_u_s_e_r, in which case it is _o_t_h_e_r_u_s_e_r.

       _~_e_u_s_e_r_/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b
              The file edited by eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn.  _e_u_s_e_r is the effective user.

       _~_e_u_s_e_r_/_c_r_o_n_t_a_b_l
              The  lock file used to assure that only one process at a time is
              editing the ccrroonndd((88)) settings.  _e_u_s_e_r is the effective user.

BBUUGGSS
       eezzmmllmm--ccrroonn should use the output of ’crontab -l’ to list crontab lines,
       rather  than parse the crontab file (and assume that the last execution
       of ccrroonnttaabb((11)) was successful).

       eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt handles mail from sublists of the main list stored in _d_i_r
       and, if it exists, the associated main digest list.   eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt  is
       used  for main list with only sublists as subscribers. It is not useful
       for normal mailing lists.

       eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt is normally invoked from a ..qqmmaaiill file.  It reads a  mail
       message  from  its standard input, and a mail envelope from the SSEENNDDEERR,
       LLOOCCAALL, and HHOOSSTT environment variables.

       eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt has two functions. It takes the place of eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt((11))
       for  main lists that have only sublists as subscribers.  Bounces do not
       lead to removal of  the  bouncing  address.   eemmzzllmm--rreecceeiipptt  saves  the
       bounce,  and  logs the event to the mail log.  eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt also saves
       the bounce to _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//ddnnnnnn..pppppp where nnnnnn is a time stamp and pppppp the
       PID  of the process. A maximum of 50 bounces are saved. Further bounces
       are discarded until room is made in the bounce  directory  by  manually
       removing  files.  If the list uses and SQL database, the even is logged
       to the _mlog  table  instead,  and  only  if  the  distribution  cookie
       matches. The bounce is still saved, but only if it contained a matching
       distribution cookie.

       eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt also handles feedback messages from  the  sublist.  These
       are  used  to  monitor  that  the sublist is able to send out messages.
       Receipt of feedback messages is logged to the mail log.   If  the  list
       uses  and  SQL database, the even is logged to the _mlog table instead,
       and only if the distribution cookie matches.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --dd     eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt will assume the message  is  for  a  digest  list.
              Normally,  eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt  will  autodetect  this from the bounce
              address. Autodetection makes  eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt  less  flexible  and
              will be removed in future versions.

       --DD     eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt  will assume that the bounce is for a normal (non-
              digest) list.  Normally, eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt will autodetect this from
              the bounce address. Autodetection makes eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt less flex‚Äê
              ible and will be removed in future versions.  --DD will become the
              default.

       eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt handles mail sent to any of the following addresses:

       _l_o_c_a_l--rreettuurrnn--
              Trash.  A help message or subscription acknowledgment bounced.

       _l_o_c_a_l--rreettuurrnn--_m_s_g--_b_o_x==_d_o_m_a_i_n
              Distribution  bounce.  Message number _m_s_g was lost on the way to
              the sublist _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n.

       _l_o_c_a_l--rreettuurrnn--_m_s_g--
              Pre-VERP distribution bounce, in QSBMF format.   Message  number
              _m_s_g  was  lost on the way to one or more sublists; eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt
              will parse the bounce to figure out the addresses.

       _l_o_c_a_l--rreettuurrnn--rreecceeiipptt
              Feedback message from a sublist.  eezzmmllmm--rreecceeiipptt will figure  out
              message number and sublist address from the envelope sender.

              For  all  the  above addresses if, _l_o_c_a_l is followed by _-_d_i_g_e_s_t,
              messages are assumed to relate  to  the  digest  list,  and  are
              stored in _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunnccee rather than in _d_i_r //bboouunnccee ..

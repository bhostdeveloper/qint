DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--ggeett  handles archive retrieval and optionally makes and sends out
       digests for the mailing list stored in _d_i_r.  Subscribers of the  digest
       list are stored in _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstt//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//.

       The  contents of _d_i_r//hheeaaddeerraadddd are added to the header of outgoing mes‐
       sages.

       If _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e is not specified on the command line, eezzmmllmm--ggeett will  try
       to read it from the file _d_i_r//ddiiggeessttccooddee ..

       eezzmmllmm--ggeett  is  normally invoked from a ..qqmmaaiill((77)) file.  It reads a mail
       message from its standard input, and a mail envelope from  the  SSEENNDDEERR,
       LLOOCCAALL, and HHOOSSTT environment variables.

       eezzmmllmm--ggeett  uses LLOOCCAALL to determine where it is invoked. If LLOOCCAALL is the
       list local name only, eezzmmllmm--ggeett assumes it is run  from  _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr  to
       produce  a digest.  The digest is sent directly to the digest list sub‐
       scribers.

       If LLOOCCAALL is empty or undefined, eezzmmllmm--ggeett assumes it is  run  from  the
       command  line  or  a  script.  In  this  case it behaves as if run from
       _d_i_r//eeddiittoorr and sends out a digest to the digest subscribers.

       Otherwise, eezzmmllmm--ggeett expects LLOOCCAALL to be of the form _l_i_s_t--_a_c_t_i_o_n.  Here
       _l_i_s_t  is  the  first line of _d_i_r//oouuttllooccaall and _a_c_t_i_o_n is a request.  The
       output is sent to the envelope sender.

       eezzmmllmm--ggeett checks _a_c_t_i_o_n for ddiigg.._d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e, iinnddeexx, tthhrreeaadd, and ggeett.  If
       _a_c_t_i_o_n  is  one  of  these,  eezzmmllmm--ggeett  handles the request and sends a
       reply. If successful, it exits  99  (ignore  remaining  ..qqmmaaiill((77))  file
       entries).   If  _a_c_t_i_o_n is not one of these, eezzmmllmm--ggeett exits 0 (success)
       to pass the message on to later handlers, such as eezzmmllmm--mmaannaaggee((11)).

       eezzmmllmm--ddiigg.._d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e returns a digest of messages  received  since  the
       last  digest, unless numerical arguments are given.  _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e must be
       alphanumeric, and match (case-insensitive) _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e on the  eezzmmllmm--ggeett
       command  line.  Otherwise,  the  request  will  be  ignored. This is to
       restrict digest creation. The body of the requesting message up to  the
       first  line  starting with ’-’ is copied into the _a_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_i_v_i_a section
       of the digest. This is followed by the contents of _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ddiiggeesstt,  if
       this file exists.

       NNoottee::  Anyone  who  can read your _d_i_r//mmaannaaggeerr and _d_i_r//ddiiggeessttccooddee files,
       digest-requesting scripts, or mail log knows  the  _d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e  and  can
       trigger digests.

       eezzmmllmm--ggeett copies the _T_X_T___M_A_I_L_I_N_G___L_I_S_T message into a MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt field
       in its response.  If the incoming message  has  a  MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt  field,
       eezzmmllmm--ggeett  refuses  to  respond.   eezzmmllmm--ggeett also refuses to respond to
       bounce messages.

       If _d_i_r//lliissttiidd exists, eezzmmllmm--ggeett will assume that the format is  correct
       and create a ‘‘List-ID:’’ header by placing the contents after the text
       ‘‘List-ID: ’’.

       If _d_i_r//qqmmqqppsseerrvveerrss exists, eezzmmllmm--ggeett wwiillll  uussee  qqmmaaiill--qqmmqqpp((11))  to  send
       digests. Other messages are sent by the normal qmail mechanism.

       If  _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc  does not exist, eezzmmllmm--ggeett rejects all archive retrieval
       attempts, unless the --pp command line switch is used.

       Archive retrieval actions can be of the form  aaccttiioonn[[ff]],  aaccttiioonn[[ff]].._n_u_m
       or  aaccttiioonn[[ff]].._n_u_m___n_u_m_2,  where _n_u_m is the message number for the action
       or _n_u_m___n_u_m_2 the range of message numbers for the action.

       ff is an optional format specifier for _-_g_e_t, _-_t_h_r_e_a_d, and _-_d_i_g requests.
       It  is allowed, but ignored for _-_i_n_d_e_x requests. Currently, the follow‐
       ing are allowed:


       rr      rfc1153. This is a ‘‘plain’’ non-MIME format for dumb clients.

       mm      (Default.) MIME _m_u_l_t_i_p_a_r_t_/_d_i_g_e_s_t with a subset of ordered  head‐
              ers  sorted.   Currently,  the following headers are included in
              the order listed: Date:, To:, From:, Reply-To:,  Cc:,  MIME-Ver‐
              sion:,  Content-Type:,  Message-ID:, and Keywords:.  This can be
              customized with the optional file _d_i_r//ddiigghheeaaddeerrss,  which  should
              contain the desired headers up to but not including the colon.

              The  format  is no longer compliant with rfc1153, as the rfc1153
              format is incompatible with rfc2046, with which  the  format  is
              (should be) compatible.

       xx      MIXED:  This is the same as the default MIME format, except that
              the Content-Type is _m_u_l_t_i_p_a_r_t_/_m_i_x_e_d.  This helps  circumnavigate
              a  Pine  bug:  when the digest is content-transfer-encoded, Pine
              will refuse to display the initial text/plain part of  a  _m_u_l_t_i_‐
              _p_a_r_t_/_d_i_g_e_s_t  message,  but  display  the  same  part of a _m_u_l_t_i_‐
              _p_a_r_t_/_m_i_x_e_d message. Some MUAs for some strange reason treat  the
              two  multipart  formats  differently. In some cases, ‘‘x’’ works
              better than ‘‘m’’.

       vv      VIRGIN: This is MIME  _m_u_l_t_i_p_a_r_t_/_d_i_g_e_s_t  with  messages  returned
              without any header filtering.

       nn      NATIVE:  This  is VIRGIN format without threading, i.e. messages
              are presented in numerical order and the message index  is  sup‐
              pressed.


       For  flexibility  and  backwards  compatibility, the ’.’ separating the
       action from the first argument can be replaced by ’-’, or omitted.  Any
       non-alphanumeric character can separate _n_u_m_2 from _n_u_m.


       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is _d_i_g_._d_i_g_e_s_t_c_o_d_e, eezzmmllmm--ggeett returns a digest of the messages
       received since the last digest, and updates the digest issue counter.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is _g_e_t, eezzmmllmm--ggeett sends back message(s) _n_u_m  or  _n_u_m  through
       _n_u_m_2.   from  _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivvee//.   If _n_u_m is omitted and _d_i_r//ddiiggnnuumm does not
       exist or is 0, the latest HISTGET message (default  30)  are  returned.
       Otherwise,  the messages since the latest digest are returned including
       the last message in that digest, so that always at least 1  message  is
       send.  If the number of messages exceeds MAXGET (default 100), only the
       MAXGET last messages are returned.  if _n_u_m is greater than  the  latest
       message  in  the  archive  _and_ _n_u_m_2 is specified, the latest messages
       back to HISTGET before the end of the latest digest up to  MAXGET  mes‐
       sages  are  returned. This is a good way of always getting at least the
       latest 30 messages without knowing the latest message  number.  A  link
       with such a command could be put into e.g.  _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ssuubb--ookk.

       _n_u_m and _n_u_m_2 are adjusted to make both > 0, and _n_u_m_2 >= _n_u_m.  If either
       is greater than the largest message number processed,  it  is  silently
       set  to the largest message number.  At most 100 messages are returned.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is iinnddeexx_, eezzmmllmm--ggeett sends back the subjects  and  authors  of
       the   message(s)   _n_u_m  or  _n_u_m  through  _n_u_m_2  in  sets  of  100  from
       _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivvee//.  _n_u_m and _n_u_m_2 are reasonable adjusted as  for  ’get’.  No
       warnings  are sent. At most 20 sets of 100 message entries are returned
       per request. If _n_u_m is omitted, eezzmmllmm--ggeett returns the last 100-200 mes‐
       sage entries, which automatically gives information about the last mes‐
       sage number.

       If _a_c_t_i_o_n is tthhrreeaadd_, eezzmmllmm--ggeett sends back the message(s) that  have  an
       index subject entry identical to that of message _n_u_m from _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivvee//.

       If _n_u_m_2 is given it is ignored. If _n_u_m is out of range, and error  mes‐
       sage  is returned. The message range scanned for the subject is limited
       to 2000 messages before and after the master message, i.e.  the  tthhrreeaadd
       argument.   This  limit protects very large archives.  Most threads are
       expected to be considerably more short-lived.  In  the  unlikely  event
       that  there  are  further  messages, these can be retrieved by a second
       request for the highest/lowest message returned in the first request.

       eezzmmllmm--ggeett reads _d_i_r//ccooppyylliinneess to determine how many lines of the origi‐
       nal  message  to copy into the outgoing message.  If this file is empty
       or not present, a value of _0 is presumed, meaning that only the  header
       is copied.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb     (Default.)   Copy  administrative information and the request to
              the bottom of replies.  This informs the recipient of other com‐
              mands,  and allows some error tracking in case the recipient did
              not originate the request.

       --BB     Suppress the normal administrative information and request copy.
              This  may  make it harder for the recipient to diagnose problems
              and learn commands.

       --cc     (Default.)  Process and  reply  to  commands  (does  not  affect
              digests).

       --CC     Ignore all commands except digest.

       --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t
              eezzmmllmm--ggeett will use _f_o_r_m_a_t as the default format for all returned
              message collections. The  default  is  the  first  character  in
              _d_i_r//ddiiggffoorrmmaatt,  or ’m’ if it does not exist.  This produces MIME
              with a header subset (see above). Format  specifiers  sent  with
              individual  requests override the default set with the --ff switch
              or the _d_i_r//ddiiggffoorrmmaatt file.

       --pp     -get, -index, and -thread commands are available to  all  users,
              provided  other  flags  are  permissive.  This  overrides normal
              behavior, which is to allow archive retrieval  only  to  modera‐
              tors,  when  _d_i_r//mmooddggeettoonnllyy exists or _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc does not exist.
              This is useful to set up non-public lists that still give  users
              archive access.

       --PP     -get, -index, and -thread commands are available only to modera‐
              tors, even if _d_i_r//ppuubblliicc exists and _d_i_r//mmooddggeettoonnllyy does not. The
              --CC  and  --ss  flags can restrict this further. This is useful for
              public lists with archive retrieval restricted to  a  subset  of
              users (moderators).

       --ss     -get,  -index, and -thread requests are processed only if SSEENNDDEERR
              is a subscriber.  This overrides normal behavior,  which  is  to
              allow  anyone to issue -get, -index, and -thread requests unless
              _d_i_r//ssuubbggeettoonnllyy exists.

       --SS     Anyone can issue -get, -index, and -thread requests.

       If _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett exists, eezzmmllmm--ggeett will use the character set listed  for
       all  messages.  Otherwise,  the  default ‘‘us-ascii’’ will be used. The
       character set can be suffixed by ‘‘:’’ followed by a code. If the  code
       is  ‘‘Q’’, outgoing messages are sent as ‘‘Quoted-Printable’’, if it is
       ‘‘B’’ they are sent ‘‘base64’’ encoded.  Otherwise, text is sent as is.

FFIILLEESS
       _d_i_r//ddiiggnnuumm
              The last message included in the latest normal mode digest.

       _d_i_r//ddiiggiissssuuee
              The issue number of the latest normal mode digest.

       _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ggeett--bbaadd

       _d_i_r//tteexxtt//ddiiggeesstt
              Copied  into the _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_i_v_i_a section of digests after the body
              of the requesting message.

       _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett
              The character set used for all eezzmmllmm--ggeett messages  (see  above).
              If  not  present,  the  default,  ‘‘us-ascii’’,  is used without
              encoding.

BBUUGGSS
       The digest format per rfc2046 should (but is not required to) be multi‐
       part/mixed with the table-of-contents a text/plain part, and the entire
       remainder of the digest a multipart/digest part.  The  multipart/digest
       in  turn  should contain all the messages. Many MUA’s fail to split out
       the individual messages from such a hierarchy, so the  format  used  by
       eezzmmllmm--ggeett is a simple multipart/digest, explicitly typing the table-of-
       contents to text/plain, with the ‘‘x’’ format changing  the  mail  con‐
       tent-type to multipart/mixed.

       eezzmmllmm--iiddxx  reads  all  archived  messages  for  the  list  in  _d_i_r from
       _d_i_r//aarrcchhiivvee// and creates a message index.  The  index  file  format  is
       identical  to  that  produced  by  eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11))  (when  _d_i_r//iinnddeexxeedd is
       present).

       eezzmmllmm--iiddxx will ignore messages that do not have the owner  execute  bit
       set.

       eezzmmllmm--iiddxx  will  create  the  the index file under a different name and
       then move it into place.

       If _d_i_r//iinnddeexxeedd does not exist, eezzmmllmm--iiddxx will create it to  enable  the
       use of the newly created subject and author index.

       eezzmmllmm--iiddxx  will remove reply-indicators and the prefix from the subject
       before entry into the index, as described for eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)).  eezzmmllmm--iiddxx
       will  decode rfc2047 encoded subject and author headers. When unfolding
       split lines, eezzmmllmm--iiddxx will remove redundant escape sequences  for  the
       character set specified in _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett.

       eezzmmllmm--iiddxx  calculates  a  subject  hash based on the normalized subject
       header. Normalization removes linear whitespace, case information,  and
       message reply indicators.  The subject hash is used by eezzmmllmm--ggeett((11)) for
       message threading.

       --dd     Use the ‘‘Date:’’ header for date information, rather  than  the
              top  ‘‘Received:’’  header.  This is unreliable, but useful when
              messages have been transferred from another type of  archive  by
              mailing  them to ezmlm.  eezzmmllmm--iiddxx converts dates with two-digit
              years ‘‘xx’’ to 19xx if xx is >= 70. Otherwise, 20xx is assumed.

       --DD     (Default.)   Use  the  ‘‘Received:’’  header,  not the ‘‘Date:’’
              header. This is more reliable since this is the header added  by
              the receiving qmail. Also, this results in always correctly for‐
              matted dates in the same time zone (usually UTC).

       --ff _m_s_g Start indexing with the archive section containing message  _m_s_g.
              This  is  useful  if you have removed part of the archive and do
              not want to create  (empty)  directories  and  index  files  for
              these. It also decreases eezzmmllmm--iiddxx memory use.

       --FF     (Default.)  Start indexing from message 1.

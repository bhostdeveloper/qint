       eezzmmllmmggllrrcc  instructs eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11)) to create _d_i_r and files within it to
       support the _l_o_c_a_l@@_h_o_s_t sublist. The sublist handles  bounces,  but  not
       subscriptions. It is intended for creation of sublists that are part of
       an SQL database supported distributed ezmlm list. For creation of regu‐
       lar sublists, use eezzmmllmm--mmaakkee((11)) with eezzmmllmmrrcc((55)).

       While  these switches can be omitted, the list will not function unless
       they are specified.

       --33 _m_a_i_n_l_o_c_a_l
              Local name of the main list for which this list is a sublist. If
              the  sublist is a sublist for digests, _m_a_i_n_l_o_c_a_l should refer to
              the mail list, i.e. stripped of ‘‘-digest’’. This is required in
              order  for the bounce texts to refer to the correct archive. Use
              the --dd switch!

       --44 _m_a_i_n_h_o_s_t
              Host name of the main list for which this list is a sublist.

       --66 _h_o_s_t_:_p_o_r_t_:_u_s_e_r_:_p_a_s_s_:_d_b_:_t_a_b_l_e
              SQL connect info. Specifies the host and port to connect to, the
              user/password  to  use,  the  database  name, and the root table
              name.  The host defaults to ‘‘localhost’’, the database and  ta‐
              ble  to  ‘‘ezmlm’’. The port default is the default for the par‐
              ticular SQL server  type  used.  For  sublists  disseminating  a
              digest, ‘‘table’’ will end in ‘‘_digest’’.

       --dd     This sublist is a sublist of a digest list.  The --33 argment used
              should be the local name of  the  main  list,  rather  than  the
              digest list, i.e. the terminal ‘‘-digest’’ should be stripped.

       --55 _o_w_n_e_r
              The  address to which to redirect mail send to _l_o_c_a_l_-oowwnneerr@@_h_o_s_t.
              The default is the owner address for the main list.

       A common task is to create both a sublist for the main list and a  sub‐
       list  for  the corresponding digest. Note that the local list names are
       given as is, whereas the main list name always refers to the main  list
       itself  (and  not  its digest). The main list is  ‘‘mainloc@mainhost’’,
       the local sublist is ‘‘me-sub1@myhost’’; the main digest is  ‘‘mainloc-
       digest@mainhost’’    and    the   local   digest   sublist   is   ‘‘me-
       sub1-digest@myhost’’.

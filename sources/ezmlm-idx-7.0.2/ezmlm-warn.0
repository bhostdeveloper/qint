       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn  sends  out  warning messages for the mailing list stored in
       _d_i_r.

       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn scans _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//dd// for directories older than _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  days
       ago  (see --tt).  The directories are created by eezzmmllmm--rreettuurrnn and contain
       bounces.  If eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn  sees  a  distribution  bounce  for  _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n
       received  more than _t_i_m_e_o_u_t days ago, it sends _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n a list of all
       the message numbers missed recently, and deletes  the  bounce.   If  it
       sees  a  warning  bounce for _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n received more than _t_i_m_e_o_u_t days
       ago, it sends _b_o_x@@_d_o_m_a_i_n a probe, and deletes the bounce.

       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn uses _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//llaassttdd to keep track of when it was last run.
       If  insufficient time has passed (see --ll) eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn exits without fur‐
       ther action.

       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn  keeps  files  with   the   bounced   message   numbers   in
       _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//hh.   Expired  files  are  removed and _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//llaasstthh keeps
       track of the last subdirectory scanned.

       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn will not send a warning or probe to an address that  is  not
       currently a subscriber.

       If  neither  the  --dd  nor the --DD option is given to eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn, it will
       process bounces for both the main and digest lists.

       eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn reads _d_i_r//ccooppyylliinneess to determine how many lines of the orig‐
       inal  message to copy into the outgoing message.  If this file is empty
       or not present, a value of _0 is presumed, meaning that only the  header
       is copied.

       If _d_i_r//nnoowwaarrnn exists, eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn exits without taking any action.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --dd     process  bounces  only for the digest list.  Digest list bounces
              are stored in _d_i_r//ddiiggeesstt//bboouunnccee// rather than in _d_i_r//bboouunnccee//.

       --DD     Process bounces only for the main list.

       --ll _l_o_c_k_o_u_t
              eezzmmllmm--wwaarrnn will abort execution if it was run less than  _l_o_c_k_o_u_t
              seconds ago. The default is _t_i_m_e_o_u_t _/ 50, which with the default
              _t_i_m_e_o_u_t is 20,000 seconds (approx. 5.6 hours). There is no  rea‐
              son  to use this switch, except for testing and possibly in com‐
              bination with --tt..

       --tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
              Bounces received more than _t_i_m_e_o_u_t days ago are processed.  This
              overrides  the default of 10 days and may possibly be useful for
              very large busy lists. Also, a _t_i_m_e_o_u_t of zero can  be  used  to
              send  a  warning  to  all  addresses for which a bounce has been
              received and a probe for all addresses for which a  warning  has
              bounces.  This is useful to rapidly clear out bouncing addresses
              from a (low quality) address list.

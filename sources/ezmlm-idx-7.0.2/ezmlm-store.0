       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree stores a main message sent to a ezmlm mailing list awaiting
       message moderation or user confirmation.

       If  _d_i_r//ccoonnffiirrmmppoosstt  exists  and  the --YY option is not set, it works in
       user confirmation mode.  Otherwise if the --yy  option  is  not  set  and
       _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt exists, it works in message moderation mode.  Otherwise the
       message is passed on to eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11)).

       If either _d_i_r//mmooddppoossttoonnllyy exists or the --PP option is set, only  modera‐
       tors  will be allowed to post.  Posts from other addresses are bounced.

       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree reads a mail message and stores it in _d_i_r//mmoodd//uunnccoonnffiirrmmeedd//.
       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree  also  sends a user confirmation request with a copy of the
       message to the envelope sender of the  message.   The  confirm  request
       includes cookies for message rejection and acceptance.

       The  sender  can  take  either  action  by  replying to the appropriate
       address.  For user convenience, the _c_o_n_f_i_r_m address  is  given  in  the
       ‘‘Reply-To:’’ header.

       Once  the  confirmation request has been successfully sent, eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree
       sets the owner-execute bit  of  the  message  in  _d_i_r//mmoodd//uunnccoonnffiirrmmeedd//.
       Messages  without  this bit set are the result of incomplete executions
       of eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree and are ignored.


MMOODDEERRAATTIIOONN
       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree reads a mail message and  stores  it  in  _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//..
       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree  also sends a moderation request with a copy of the message
       to the list of moderators stored in _d_i_r//mmoodd//ssuubbssccrriibbeerrss//..  If  _d_i_r//mmoodd‐‐
       ppoosstt  contains  a directory name, _m_o_d_d_i_r, with a leading forward slash,
       the moderator list in _/_m_o_d_d_i_r_/_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e_r_s_/ is used instead. This allows
       separate sets of moderators for subscription and message moderation, as
       well as the use of the same moderator list for  several  eezzmmllmm  mailing
       lists, owned by the same user. If the --ss switch is used, the moderators
       are divided into two sets. Those pointed to by _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt  which  will
       receive  confirmation requests for posts with their SENDER address, and
       those stored with the base directory _d_i_r//mmoodd// which will receive moder‐
       ation  requests  for messages posted from SENDERs not part of the first
       group. This can be used to have a set of trusted users  (‘‘moderating’’
       themselves to thwart SENDER faking), and a set of more traditional mod‐
       erators, which receive approval requests for other posts.

       NNoottee:: The contents of _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt do not affect  the  location  of  the
       message moderation queue.

       If SENDER is a moderator, the request is sent to that moderator only.

       The  moderation  request  includes  cookies  for  message rejection and
       acceptance.  The moderator can take either action by  replying  to  the
       appropriate  address.  For moderator convenience, the _a_c_c_e_p_t address is
       given in the ‘‘Reply-To:’’  header,  and  the  _r_e_j_e_c_t  address  in  the
       ‘‘From:’’ header.

       If  the list is set up with remote administration and the sender is not
       a moderator, the ‘‘Cc:’’ header will contain a confirmation address  to
       add  the sender to the ‘‘allow’’ database. This allows the moderator to
       both approve the post and add  the  sender  to  the  list  of  accepted
       posters by replying to ‘‘all’’.

       The  default subject of all message moderation requests is MMOODDEERRAATTEE ffoorr
       _l_i_s_t_n_a_m_e_@_h_o_s_t.   The  default  subject  of  all  message   confirmation
       requests is CCoonnffiirrmm ppoosstt ttoo _l_i_s_t_n_a_m_e_@_h_o_s_t.

       Once  the  request has been successfully sent to the moderators, eezzmmllmm--
       ssttoorree sets the owner-execute bit of the  message  in  _d_i_r//mmoodd//ppeennddiinngg//..
       Messages  without  this bit set are the result of incomplete executions
       of eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree and are ignored.

       At the beginning of the message, eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree prints a new  MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt
       field  with  the  contents of the _T_X_T___M_A_I_L_I_N_G___L_I_S_T message.  It rejects
       the message if there is already a MMaaiilliinngg--LLiisstt field.

       eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree does not distribute bounce  messages:  if  the  environment
       variable  SSEENNDDEERR  is  set,  and  is  either  empty or ##@@[[]], eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree
       rejects the message.

       --bb     (Default.)  With the moderation request, send both  headers  and
              body of the message to be moderated.

       --BB     With  the  moderation  request, send header, but not body of the
              message to be moderated.  This may be useful  if  moderation  is
              used  to  allow one or a few poorly connected addresses to post,
              and posts are very large (e.g. when the list is used as  a  dis‐
              tribution channel of e.g. catalogs).

       --ccCCrrRR  Passed  on  to  eezzmmllmm--sseenndd((11))  in case this program is executed.
              This happens only if _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt and  _d_i_r//ccoonnffiirrmmppoosstt  does  not
              exist.

       --mm     (Default.)  The post is sent as a MIME enclosure.

       --MM     The post is appended to the message.

       --ss     The  contents  of _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt with the default _d_i_r//mmoodd// are used
              as the base directory for self-approving users, whereas _d_i_r//mmoodd//
              is  used  as  the  base  directory  for  the  moderators to whom
              approval requests for other posts are sent.

       --SS     (Default.)   The  contents  of  _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt  with  the   default
              _d_i_r//mmoodd//  are  used as the base directory for the moderators for
              all moderator functions.

       --pp     (Default.)  Anyone can post. Posts that are not from a moderator
              are sent out to all moderators for approval. Posts that are from
              a moderator are sent only to that moderator. This is the default
              unless the _d_i_r//mmooddppoossttoonnllyy file exists.

       --PP     Only  moderators  can  post. Those posts are sent to the posting
              moderator for approval. Posts from other addresses are  bounced.
              This  can  be used to relatively securely restrict posts to mes‐
              sages originating from a given set of addresses.

       --yy     Run in post confirmation mode even if _d_i_r//ccoonnffiirrmmppoosstt  does  not
              exists.

       --YY     Ignore  _d_i_r//ccoonnffiirrmmppoosstt..   (This option is useful if eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree
              is called after post confirmation, to allow message moderation.)

UUSSAAGGEE
       First  of  all,  remember  that  eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree will simply execute eezzmmllmm--
       sseenndd((11)) unless _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt exists, _d_i_r//ccoonnffiirrmmppoosstt exists, or --yy option
       is specified.  For the switches, use --PP for lists where only moderators
       can post securely, i.e. they are asked to approve their own posts after
       posting, whereas other SENDERs are rejected. For low-security more con‐
       venient versions of this type of restriction, see eezzmmllmm--ggaattee((11)).

       Normally (no switches), posts from moderators  are  sent  for  approval
       only  to  the sending moderator, whereas posts from other addresses are
       sent to all moderators.  Thus, you can set up an announcement  list  by
       adding  all potential posters as moderators. However, you may also want
       to allow others to post, as long as the posts are approved. This  would
       be default eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree function.

       To  make  the  set of ‘‘approved posters’’ who approve their own posts,
       different from the set of  addresses  that  approve  posts  from  other
       users,  use  the  --ss switch. Add a directory name to _d_i_r//mmooddppoosstt.  This
       directory is the base directory of the ‘‘approved  posters’’  database.
       Add the moderators for other posts to _d_i_r//mmoodd// using eezzmmllmm--ssuubb((11)).

       If  _d_i_r//cchhaarrsseett  exists,  eezzmmllmm--ssttoorree will use the character set listed
       for all messages. Otherwise, the default ‘‘us-ascii’’ will be used. The
       character  set can be suffixed by ‘‘:’’ followed by a code. If the code
       is ‘‘Q’’, outgoing messages are sent as ‘‘Quoted-Printable’’, if it  is
       ’‘B’’ they are sent ‘‘base64’’ encoded.  Otherwise, text is sent as is.

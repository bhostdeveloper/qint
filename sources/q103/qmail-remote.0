       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee  reads a mail message from its input and sends the message
       to one or more recipients at a remote host.

       The remote host is qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee’s first argument,  _h_o_s_t.   qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee
       sends  the  message  to _h_o_s_t, or to a mail exchanger for _h_o_s_t listed in
       the Domain Name System, via the Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP).
       _h_o_s_t can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

            silverton.berkeley.edu

       or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

            [128.32.183.163]

       The  envelope  recipient  addresses  are  listed  as _r_e_c_i_p arguments to
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee.  The envelope sender address is listed as _s_e_n_d_e_r.

       Note that qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee does not take options and does  not  follow  the
       ggeettoopptt standard.

TTRRAANNSSPPAARREENNCCYY
       End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.  A dot at the beginning of
       a line is encoded as dot dot.  It is impossible in SMTP to send a  mes‐
       sage  that does not end with a newline.  qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee converts the UNIX
       newline convention into the SMTP newline  convention  by  inserting  CR
       before each LF.

       It  is a violation of the SMTP protocol to send a message that contains
       long lines or non-ASCII characters.  However, qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will happily
       send  such messages.  It is the user’s responsibility to avoid generat‐
       ing illegal messages.

RREESSUULLTTSS
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee prints some number of _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t  _r_e_p_o_r_t_s,  followed  by  a
       _m_e_s_s_a_g_e  _r_e_p_o_r_t.   Each  report is terminated by a 0 byte.  Each report
       begins with a single letter:

       r    Recipient report: acceptance.

       h    Recipient report: permanent rejection.

       s    Recipient report: temporary rejection.

       K    Message report: success.  _h_o_s_t has taken responsibility for deliv‐
            ering the message to each acceptable recipient.

       Z    Message report: temporary failure.

       D    Message report: permanent failure.

       After  this letter comes a human-readable description of what happened.

       The recipient reports will always be  printed  in  the  same  order  as
       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee’s  _r_e_c_i_p  arguments.  Note that in failure cases there may
       be fewer recipient reports than _r_e_c_i_p arguments.

       qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee always exits zero.

       _h_e_l_o_h_o_s_t
            Current host name, for use solely in saying hello  to  the  remote
            SMTP  server.   Default: _m_e, if that is supplied; otherwise qqmmaaiill--
            rreemmoottee refuses to run.

       _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s
            Artificial SMTP routes.  Each route has the form

               _d_o_m_a_i_n::_r_e_l_a_y _u_s_e_r _p_a_s_s

            _w_i_t_h_o_u_t _a_n_y _e_x_t_r_a _s_p_a_c_e_s _b_e_t_w_e_e_n  _d_o_m_a_i_n  and  _r_e_l_a_y_.   If  _d_o_m_a_i_n
            matches  _h_o_s_t,  qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will connect to _r_e_l_a_y, as if _h_o_s_t had
            _r_e_l_a_y as its only MX.  (It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups
            on  _r_e_c_i_p.)   _h_o_s_t  may  include  a colon and a port number to use
            instead of the normal SMTP port, 25:

               inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26

            _r_e_l_a_y may be empty; this tells qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee to look up MX  records
            as usual.  _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s may include wildcards:

               .af.mil:
               :heaven.af.mil

            Here  any  address  ending with ..aaff..mmiill (but not aaff..mmiill itself) is
            routed by its MX records; any other address is artificially routed
            to hheeaavveenn..aaff..mmiill.

            _u_s_e_r  and  _p_a_s_s  may be empty; if present they will be used as the
            userid and password for an AUTH command  when  connecting  to  the
            remote  SMTP  server. Note that in order to be used, both _u_s_e_r and
            _p_a_s_s must be present, and must be separated from the  prior  items
            on the line by exactly one space. This means that _u_s_e_r cannot con‐
            tain any spaces, although _p_a_s_s may contain spaces, and in fact  if
            any  "extra"  spaces are present at the end of the line, they will
            be considered part of the password. (You have been warned.)

            Note that qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will not send AUTH  commands  over  a  non-
            secured  connection  (i.e. if a STARTTLS command has not been suc‐
            cessfully sent.) This is done on purpose, to prevent  your  server
            from sending a password across the internet in clear text. If _u_s_e_r
            starts with a "-" character, the "-"  will  be  removed  and  this
            security  check  will be bypassed. Think of this as qmail-remote’s
            version of the ALLOW_INSECURE_AUTH variable used by qmail-smtpd.

            The qqmmaaiill system does not protect you if you create an  artificial
            mail  loop  between  machines.  However, you are always safe using
            _s_m_t_p_r_o_u_t_e_s if you do not accept mail from the network.

       _t_i_m_e_o_u_t_c_o_n_n_e_c_t
            Number of seconds qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee  will  wait  for  the  remote  SMTP
            server  to accept a connection.  Default: 60.  The kernel normally
            imposes a 75-second upper limit.

       _t_i_m_e_o_u_t_r_e_m_o_t_e
            Number of seconds qqmmaaiill--rreemmoottee will wait for  each  response  from
            the remote SMTP server.  Default: 1200.

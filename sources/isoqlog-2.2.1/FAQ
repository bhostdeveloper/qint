		ISOQLOG FAQ
	-----------------------------

Q. I notice that I can see size of sent messages, but I can't see size of incoming
   meesages

A. Because logs only show size for "from" addresses, but not "to" addresses. Additionally
   because of the inconsistency of log files, one ID may show up for other mails as well.
   But this will be fixed in isoqlog 3.0

What is EnderUNIX?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

EnderUNIX SDT (Open Source Software Development Team), is a bunch of
people who gathered to develop free  software for Open Source community
from Turkey. They are some people who realized the importance of "sharing"
in their hearts, and distributing software for public use.

Topic Interested

As a team, our main goal is to develop useful programs, that will run
platform-independetly on any *NIX flavor. Besides you are going to see
some Turkish HELP/HOWTO for *BSD systems. They may be either translations
to Turkish, or written from scratch.

Hafiye is a POSIX-compliant, customizable TCP/IP packet sniffer. Instead
of interpreting protocols according to the data structures supplied by
the operating system, it interprets Layer II, III, and IV as well as
the payload, according to the knowledge base that it constructs from
the user-supplied protocol configuration files.

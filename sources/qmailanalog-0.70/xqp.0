       xxqqpp  reads  message  lines  and  delivery lines printed by mmaattcchhuupp.  It
       prints the lines that involve messages with long-term queue  identifier
       _q_p.

       Long-term  queue  identifiers  are not permanent identifiers.  They are
       based on process IDs; 15-bit process IDs can easily wrap around in less
       than an hour on a busy system.

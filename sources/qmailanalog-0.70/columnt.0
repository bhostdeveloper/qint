       ccoolluummnntt reads a table of whitespace-separated lines.

       ccoolluummnntt  then  prints the table, changing the spacing so that the first
       column takes the same amount of space in every line, the second  column
       takes the same amount of space in every line, etc.

       In the ccoolluummnntt output, all columns except the last are right-justified;
       the last column is left-justified.  There are two spaces between  adja‚Äê
       cent columns.

       ccoolluummnntt needs enough memory to read the entire input.  Other than this,
       it has no limits on line length or on the number of columns.

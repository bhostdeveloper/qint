       mmaattcchhuupp  reads  a series of lines from qqmmaaiill--sseenndd, with a numeric time‐
       stamp in front of each line.  mmaattcchhuupp matches the end of each  delivery
       attempt  with  the  start of the delivery attempt and with the relevant
       message information;  it  replaces  qqmmaaiill--sseenndd's  message  reports  and
       delivery  reports  with  message lines and delivery lines in the format
       described below.

       mmaattcchhuupp exits after it sees end of file.  It  prints  pending  messages
       and  deliveries  on  descriptor  5, in a format suitable for input to a
       future invocation of mmaattcchhuupp:

          <log.1 matchup >out.1 5>pending.2
          cat pending.2 log.2 | matchup >out.2 5>pending.3
          cat pending.3 log.3 | matchup >out.3 5>pending.4

       Note that the 5> notation does not work with csh.

       A message line summarizes the delivery results for a message  that  has
       left the queue:

          m _b_i_r_t_h _d_o_n_e _b_y_t_e_s _n_k _n_z _n_d <_s_e_n_d_e_r> _q_p _u_i_d

       Here _b_i_r_t_h and _d_o_n_e are timestamps, _b_y_t_e_s is the number of bytes in the
       message, _n_k is the number of successful deliveries, _n_z is the number of
       deferred  delivery  attempts,  _n_d  is  the  number  of  failed delivery
       attempts, _s_e_n_d_e_r is the message's return  path,  _q_p  is  the  message's
       long-term  queue  identifier,  and  _u_i_d  is the userid of the user that
       queued the message.

       Note that mmaattcchhuupp converts _s_e_n_d_e_r to lowercase.  This can lose informa‐
       tion, since a few hosts pay attention to the case in the box part of an
       address.

       A delivery line shows the result of a single delivery attempt:

          d _r_e_s_u_l_t _b_i_r_t_h _d_s_t_a_r_t _d_d_o_n_e _b_y_t_e_s
          <_s_e_n_d_e_r> _c_h_a_n._r_e_c_i_p _q_p _u_i_d _r_e_a_s_o_n

       Here _b_i_r_t_h, _b_y_t_e_s, _s_e_n_d_e_r, _q_p,  and  _u_i_d  are  message  information  as
       above;  _c_h_a_n  is  the channel for this delivery; _r_e_c_i_p is the recipient
       address for this delivery; _d_s_t_a_r_t and _d_d_o_n_e are timestamps;  _r_e_s_u_l_t  is
       the  letter k for success, z for deferral, d for failure; and _r_e_a_s_o_n is
       a more detailed explanation of the delivery result.

       mmaattcchhuupp converts _r_e_c_i_p to lowercase.
